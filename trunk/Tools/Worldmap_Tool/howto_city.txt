			Map/Town Editing Instructions
			^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Notice that when you load a game Fallout lists the area you're in as well as the location 
within that town?  Well Fallout's maps are divided into Areas and then into Maps.


- Maps -------------------------------

All maps that are part of a town should be added to the data\maps.txt file.

Example entry:


; [Map #] - New maps will have a # greater than 150 ( > 150).

[Map 146]

; This is the map's name/title.

lookup_name=City Encounter 8

; This is the map's filename without the extension.

map_name=city8


; The music file to be played in the map without the extension.

music=10labone

; These are the ambient (background) noises you hear at random intervals

ambient_sfx=gntlwin1:25, gntlwind:25, gustwind:10, rattle:15, rattle1:15,
vulture:10

; Determines if the map stores information about its condition after you exit.

saved=No

; Determines if dead bodies age over time. 

dead_bodies_age=No

; This determines if you can rest at any of the three elevations on the map.
; Maps may include up to three different elevations.  Default is "Yes"

can_rest_here=No,No,No  ; All 3 elevations

; Random start points on the map, usually for random encounters.  By default 
; Fallout will use the start locations defined on the map itself.

; random_start_point_# - label for the random start location
; elev:# - elevation the player starts at.  Usually always 0.
; tile_num: the exact tile number the player appears at on the map.

random_start_point_0=elev:0, tile_num:17692
random_start_point_1=elev:0, tile_num:22105
random_start_point_2=elev:0, tile_num:20510
random_start_point_3=elev:0, tile_num:20890
random_start_point_4=elev:0, tile_num:23503


; End of Map Section


- Towns/Areas ------------------------

Now for the actual town itself.

Example:

; [Area #] This defines the area's number.

[Area 02]                ; This example would be Klamath

; The name of the Area, in this case, Klamath

area_name=Klamath

; The location of the area on the world map.  The origin (0,0) location is in the 
; upper left.

world_pos=373,122

; Defines the area's initial state.  If a map is "On" it is visible on the World Map.
; Vault 13 and the Ghost Farm would be "off" since they only become available after
; the game scripts makes them visible.

start_state=On

; The size of the map circle seen on the world map.  "Large" would be a circle the size of
; any of the major cities' circles (New Reno, Klamath, Modoc, etc.), "Medium" cricles denote
; lesser locations like Vault 15, the Raider's Hideout, etc.  "Small" circles are for tiny 
; locations like the Ghost Farm, the Toxic Caves, etc.

size=Large

; The Town's graphic file index.  This is the graphic you see when you re-enter a town 
; and are able to choose what section you want to appear at.

townmap_art_idx=158

; The index of the graphic used for the area's blue and white label on the far right of the 
; worldmap.

townmap_label_art_idx=377

; Locations of the sections/towns the Area contains.

; entrance_# - label for the section
; On/Off - The available locations the player may choose to move to when first entering the
;          town.  Usually there is only one "On" so when the player enters the town for the
;          first time, he/she will appear at that location in the area first.
; #,#      Where the town/zone's triangle will appear on the Area's graphic after the player 
;          has entered that zone.  Put -1,-1 if you don't want a triangle to appear.
; MapName  The name of the town/map to be placed at this location.  See the map section above.
; #,#,#    Unknown at this time.


entrance_0=On,309,203,Klamath Downtown,-1,-1,0
entrance_1=Off,155,264,Klamath Mall,-1,-1,0
entrance_2=Off,-1,-1,Klamath Rat Caves,-1,-1,0
entrance_3=Off,292,315,Klamath Trapping Caves,-1,-1,0
entrance_4=Off,-1,-1,Klamath Grazing Area,-1,-1,0
entrance_5=Off,-1,-1,Klamath Canyon,-1,-1,0


; Oh but get this:  You can't add your own new Towns, the game will crash if you do.  However
; You can replace one of the existing towns, or even one of the Towns that never actually
; show up in the game e.g. EPA, The Abbey, etc.
