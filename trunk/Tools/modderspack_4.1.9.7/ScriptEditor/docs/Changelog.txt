Alpha 1
Can save/load/compile. Support for multiple files. Displays raw compiler output after compilation
Has syntax highlighting, and folds code between begin/ends

sslc can preprocess, has optimization pass, support for arrays, hex constants, for and foreach loops, etc.

Alpha 2
new menu options: Register script, edit menu, compile all open files, batch compile, outline

sslc no longer hangs if too many errors are output, some optimization bugs fixed.
Unreferenced procedure warnings are no longer given for procedures that are called directly by fallout.

Alpha 3
Search capability, current document, all open documents, all files in folder. supports regex and storing a list of matches.
Along with the raw compiler output a neat list of errors is created, with jumpto support.
Highlighting rules for msg files
Decompilation support via int2ssl
Window position is now remembered

Alpha 4
Hovering the mouse over the tab of an open file now displays the full path to that file
New menu options to preprocess or roundtrip a file
The error list is now shared between all open windows, instead of each one having its own unique list
The error list now shows messages as well as errors and warnings, and sorts in order of importance
Improved the register script option

sslc now has a preprocess only option. Yet more optimization bugs fixed. Optimization messages are now printed in the same format as errors/warnings.

Alpha 5
Some messages and warnings which previously displayed the wrong file name in the errors window have been corrected
Hovering the mouse over some types of text displays tooltips
A names window, listing procedures and variables
A context menu on the editor, containing tools like jump to definition and find references
The optimizer is better at locating procedures to remove, can propagate and remove global variables, can remove empty if/else blocks, and can remove unused strings from a program namespace
The editor can create new files from templates

Alpha 6
Fixed a crash which could occur when trying to parse functions with more than 1 local variable
Fixed a wrong code error in the optimizer in while loops
Fixed a missed optimization that caused dead store removals to not propagate properly.
Reverted a change that caused for and foreach loops to require a begin/end around the loop body. (switch statements still require them.)

Alpha 7
Fixed another wrong code bug in the optimizer
New optimization passes to try and remove more unneeded stores
Improvements to script registration

Alpha 8
Fixed macros with mutliple arguments but no definition crashing the parser
Fixed closing the last but one tab leaving the editor in an invalid state
Fixed a crash when trying to open an include specified by a relative path of an unsaved file
Add comments to new lines in scripts.h

2.10
Fixed a race condition that would cause a hang when saving a file while the parser was running

2.10.0.5 by phobos2077
1) Pressing Ctrl+F always gives focus to Search Text field (in some cases it didn't before)
2) Pressing Esc in Search window - closes it
3) Editor Settings are now stored in Current Working Directory, instead of Users directory (can have two editors with different compile script paths for example)
4) Added 2 options in Settings window: Convert Tabs to spaces and Tab size
5) (hopefully) fixed a nasty bug: when using code Tree View to the right it showed last parsed tab, instead of currently opened
6) Made it so all fallout/sfall script commands will be highlighted (sfall commands in bold).
7) Errors tab is opened upon unsuccessful compile
8) Implemented extremely simple drag-n-drop reordering of Tabs
9) Added GoTo Line command
10) Added commands "UPPERCASE" and "lowercase" selected text
11) Fixed Close Tab in buttom tab control closing document instead
12) Added "Close All" and "Close all but this" commands
13) Fixed "Replace All" corrupting document when search string had different length than replace string
14) Visually improved Code Navigator (treeview)
15) When closing current tab, last tab becomes active instead of first
16) Ability to drag&drop files into Script Editor

3.5 by phobos2077
Added all new sfall functions and macros to SSL syntax highlighting
Reintegrated the parser (and enabled by default) - finally supporting new syntax and functions - in line with the compiler
Added parser output tab
.h files will be attempted to be parsed as .ssl

3.6
Added hotkeys for Find Definition, Find Declaration, Open include options
Fixed parser not being able to open procedure definitions in other files when included through an intermediate header
Added help tooltips for ALL scripting functions
Added primitive code auto-completion for all known opcodes as well as current script globals and macros
When clicking on a row in Errors tab, you will be taken to the column where the error occured, rather than to the whole line
Fixed local variables not showing up in tooltips
Initial values for variables and procedure arguments are now shown in tooltips, when available
Changed application icon
Changed handling of failed parsing - if preprocessing was successful, constants and macros will still be available in hints and autocomplete
Parser timeout after editing text was increased, as well as it's durability against script errors (it will now fail on serious syntax errors only)
