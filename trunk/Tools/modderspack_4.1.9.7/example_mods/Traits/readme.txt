Improved character development mod for fallout 2 by Timeslip
v1.4
----------------------------------------

To use, simply extract the contents of this archive to your fallout 2 directory. If you are using a version of this mod from before 1.3, or have not used this mod before, you will need to start a new game. If you are already using 1.3 or newer, updating will not effect you save games.

There are currently a total of 6 traits and 5 perks available. You can only pick one extra trait per character, which must be chosen from the character screen at any time before advancing to level 2. Perks will become available at specific levels just like the normal ones.

This mod should be compatible with any other mods, as long as they don't use conflicting sfall functions.
