Get drunk mod for fallout 2 by Timeslip
----------------------------------------

To use, extract the contents of this archive to your fallout 2 directory, and then go and drink some booze. You will suffer varying levels of blurred vision which cap out after drinking 10 bottles. It takes one minute for the effects of each bottle to wear off. Only booze is affected; other alcoholic drinks aren't changed.

This mod is a simple example of a global script, so I've also included an uncompiled copy in the scripts folder.

Obviously you need to be using sfall with the script extender turned on in order to use this mod. You also need to set the graphics mode to 4 or 5 in order for the shaders to work.
