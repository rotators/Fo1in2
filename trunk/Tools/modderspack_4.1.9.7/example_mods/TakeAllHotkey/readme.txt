----------------------------------------

- makes pressing the semicolon key send an uppercase A after a semicolon.
- Note: the uppercase A (shift + A if Caps Lock is off) is the built-in hotkey for the TAKE ALL button on the loot screen.

To use, copy *.int file to your scripts folder.

This mod is a simple example of how you can use HOOK_KEYPRESS hooks.
