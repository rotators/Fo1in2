AP costs mod for fallout 2 by phobos2077
----------------------------------------

- increases AP cost of using all misc items to 4
- AP are reduced even when using items (eg. stimpaks) from the inventory


To use, copy gl_itemapcost.int to your scripts folder.

This mod is a simple example of a global script, so I've also included an uncompiled copy in the scripts folder.
