To use 32-bit images for talking heads, you need to create a subfolder in art\heads\ with the name of the talking head FRM file without the extension, and put one image per frame into it named 0.png, 1.png, etc. (They don't actually have to be in PNG format, they just have to have that extension.)

You can use the included patcher to patch FRM files for loading 32-bit images from the corresponding folders.

Starting from sfall 4.1.7, you don't have to patch FRM files. If FRM files are not patched, then special files can be placed in the folers (just create an empty file with that name):

* highlight.off - disable corner highlights on the dialog display screen.

* highlight.on - enable corner highlights on the dialog display screen, and sfall will try to load a special 32-bit highlight.png texture file in art\stex\ as highlights. This is recommended if the FRM file does not have a transparent background.

* background.off - use this if the FRM file has its own background (e.g. Arroyo elder's talking head). This will allow faster creation of an image mask for the texture before displaying the image.
