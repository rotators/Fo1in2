* HOW TO USE ENGINE FUNCTIONS:
*
* in ASM code, call offsets directly, don't call wrappers as they might not be _stdcall
* in C++ code, use wrappers (add new ones if the don't exist yet, see Wrappers_def.h)
*
* Note: USE C++! 
* 1) Place thin __declspec(naked) hooks, only use minimum ASM to pass values to/from C++
* 2) Call _stdcall functions from (1), write those entirely in C++ (with little ASM blocks only to call engine functions, when you are too lazy to add wrapper)
