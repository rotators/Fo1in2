
HOW TO USE:
1. Extract _ART_ and _SOUND/SPEECH/_ folder from the Fallout 1 master.dat file and copy them contents into Fallout2\Fallout1Port\data\
2. Copy the Fallout1Port into the Fallout 2 folder and overwrite all Fo1 files if it asks for that.

3. MAKE THE DATA/PROTO/ FOLDER READ ONLY! 

4. Shit should work now.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Glow elevator graphic for level 4,5,6 is not available (engine issue?)

- There is a bug with party members when they level up. They will holster their weapons and likely not attack anymore. You'll have to talk to them and tell them to use their best weapon to reset this.
This bug is likely related to the party member armor mod.
