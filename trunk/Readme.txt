
HOW TO USE:
1. Copy the Fallout1Port into the Fallout 2 folder.
2. Change the paths in fallout2.cfg (for master.dat, critter.dat, etc... Has to point to the Fallout 2 files. I'm too lazy for that right now).
3. Extract art and sound folder from the Fallout 1 master.dat file and copy them contents into Fallout1Port\data\
4. Shit should work now.

KNOWN ISSUES:
Game crashs all the time for whatever reason.
