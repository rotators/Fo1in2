This mod replaces Fallout 2's green circles, as well as the 
worldmap tiles with city locations to bring the game's look
more in line with the original Fallout 1. 

Installation:
open the ddraw.ini and uncomment "PatchFile1=mods\fo1_classic_worldmap"!
The game will now load the additional mod folder.
