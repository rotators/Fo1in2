{1102}{}{Your actions have revealed you to be a champion of the people. Your war against evil and villainy is widely known. Honorable people will respect you better.}
{1103}{}{You have killed children, the youth of the wasteland. This is considered to be a really bad thing. You evil, evil person.}
{1104}{}{You thoroughly enjoy Nuka-Cola, the pop of the post-nuclear world.}

{1113}{}{You know sex. You know foreplay. You know how to please a member of the opposite sex and leave them hungry for more.}
{1114}{}{You are the heavyweight champion of Northern California. You have gained fame, respect, the love of thousands... and a bonus to your toughness and unarmed skill.}
{1115}{}{Let's be honest: You sleep with anything that walks on two legs. Sometimes, you're not even that discriminating.}
{1116}{}{"They're dead, they don't care," has become your motto. Digging up the remains of others is more than a hobby for you.}
{1117}{}{You are a "Made Man" of the Salvatore Family. You are well-known, well-respected, and look great in a fedora.}
{1118}{}{You got hitched. Hey, it's your problem, not ours.}
