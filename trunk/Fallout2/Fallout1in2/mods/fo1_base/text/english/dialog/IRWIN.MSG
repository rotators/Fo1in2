{100}{}{You see: Irwin.}
{101}{}{Oh boy, can't you leave me alone? I have enough problems on my hands already.}
{102}{}{Problems? Maybe I can help you.}
{103}{}{Like you are the only one with problems.}
{104}{}{Okay, okay. No reason to yell at me.}
{105}{}{Hmm... I don't know. It takes a different caliber of hero than you. Listen, why don't you come back when you have a little more experience under your belt?}
{106}{}{This is a tragedy, believe me. Nothing is the way it used to be. I have a small farm outside town and a few days ago a bunch of raiders appeared out of nowhere and now use my home as their camp. They killed Pugsley, my donkey and they threatened to kill me if I ever dare to come back.}
{107}{}{Just tell me where and I'll take care of the rest.}
{108}{}{Sorry Irwin, but I have more important things to do.}
{109}{}{Really, you would do that? You know, I don't dare to go there any more. Why don't you come back and let me know when it is safe to go back home again?}
{110}{}{Listen freak, I told you to let me alone in the first place. Now beat it!}
{111}{}{I knew you would chicken out. Everyone does when it comes to the raiders.}
{112}{}{So, have you been able to teach those raiders a lesson? Is my home safe again?}
{113}{}{It sure is, buddy.}
{114}{}{I didn't have the time yet to take care of it.}
{115}{}{Oh, thank you so much. I am sorry I don't have any riches to give to you, but here, take this for saving my home. It was my father's, passed down to him from Grandpa Rick. You probably need it more than I do.}
{116}{}{You're trying to fool me, right? Please don't play with me. Come back and let me know when it is really safe to get back into my home, will you?}
{117}{}{Thank you so much for helping me.}

# Fo1in2:
{2000}{}{First, right after leaving the Hub you will follow the main road eastwards for a few miles, past the old rail road station. Then circle down south, you will find the old Cooper farm (you can't miss it). Walk right past it, and then ... }

{2501}{}{Thanks again.}
{2502}{}{There is much work to do.}
{2503}{}{These raiders trashed my table.}
{2504}{}{Oh god, will you look at this?}
{2505}{}{Hello.}
{2506}{}{You're still here?}
{2507}{}{Hope you're put that gun to good use!}
