{100}{}{You see a cheery man with close-cropped hair.}
{101}{}{You see the town's trader, Tine.}
{102}{}{We don't get many strangers around here. What do you want?}
{103}{}{Hello, stranger! What can I do for you today?}
{104}{}{My name's }
{105}{}{.}
{106}{}{Can I ask you about the Hub merchants?}
{107}{}{I'd like to do some trading.}
{108}{}{What's your take on Adytum?}
{109}{}{Nuthin'.}
{110}{}{Yeah, I trade with 'em.}
{111}{}{I do some trading with them from time to time. Mostly I sell bullets in exchange for food.}
{112}{}{I'm Tine. You have some business to conduct?}
{113}{}{Pleasure to meet you. I'm Tine.}
{114}{}{Great doin' business with you. Come again.}
{115}{}{Whatever.}
{116}{}{Keep in touch!}
{117}{}{What?}
{118}{}{Hello again! What can I help you with?}
{119}{}{It's a good town. Might be a little happier if the Regulators didn't keep such a tight grip on things. But hey, that's their style.}
{120}{}{Ain't a bad little town. Zimmerman's a fair man, maybe not the brightest guy. And of course we've got Miles, probably the only man in a hundred miles who knows anything about science.}
