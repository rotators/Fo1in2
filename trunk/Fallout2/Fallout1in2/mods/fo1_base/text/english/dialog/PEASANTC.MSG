{101}{}{I've heard bad things about you, are they true?}
{102}{}{Hi.}
{103}{}{This is my place, wanna hang out for a while?}
{104}{}{Hmm, you look juicy... }
{105}{}{I hope you're not going to kick me out of here.}
{106}{}{No.}
{107}{}{That's a strange way to start a conversation.}
{108}{}{Hnnn.}
{109}{}{Oh, well, if you want to stay a while, go right ahead. I think we are safe here.}
{110}{}{Well, you gotta be careful these days. I hope you're having a better life than I am.}
{111}{}{Well, it's true. After what happened to my friends, I gotta protect my turf. I just hope you're not gonna kill me.}
{112}{}{No, I won't hurt you. Much.}
{113}{}{Why do you say that?}
{114}{}{Gack!}
{115}{}{No reason. Really.}
