{100}{}{You see a stern, young Initiate with a book.}
{101}{}{You see: Initiate Brenden.}
{102}{}{Good day. How may I be of assistance?}
{103}{}{I'm looking for Head Scribe Vree.}
{104}{}{I'm looking for General Maxson.}
{105}{}{I'm looking for Paladin Rhombus.}
{106}{}{What're you reading?}
{107}{}{Gaahh.}
{108}{}{Hmm. Apparently I may not be of assistance.}
{109}{}{Head Scribe Vree is on level three, in the Computer Lab.}
{110}{}{General Maxson is usually on level four, in the Council Chambers.}
{111}{}{Paladin Rhombus spends most of his time on level one, in the Supply Room.}
{112}{}{Is there anything else I can help you with?}
{113}{}{Thanks. Good day.}
{114}{}{Actually, it is a journal that I am keeping. I'm working on a treatise on the social dynamics of the Brotherhood.}
{115}{}{Hmm. Sounds interesting.}
{116}{}{So, what's the point?}
{117}{}{Indeed. I've been researching information about our predecessors from before the war and about the societies of the outside world. I think that the Brotherhood comes closest in organization to the Knights Templar of the so-called 'Dark Ages'.}
{118}{}{Why did you decide to study this?}
{119}{}{The Knights Templar?}
{120}{}{Although the Brotherhood places a high emphasis on hard sciences and applications technology, there has been little in the way of research into the soft sciences, like psychology and sociology. For a well-rounded education, we must apply scientific thought to all endeavors.}
{121}{}{So what have you discovered?}
{122}{}{I've come to the conclusion that the Brotherhood functions mostly like a pseudo-religious organization. We have the strong military hierarchy, combined with codes of honor passed down from our ancestors. Combine this with our technical skills and I think that there are two paths of development for the Brotherhood: a techno-religious dictatorship or a benevolent research society.}
{123}{}{What could influence the development of the Brotherhood?}
{124}{}{Ultimately we have a command heirarchy, with the Elders at the top. The most influential positions, then, are the Elders and the High Elder. A charismatic High Elder could direct the Brotherhood almost completely. We need to be careful to make sure that we have a leader who is both strong and visionary. Thankfully, I think that General Maxson fits that description.}
{125}{}{According to my research, the Knights Templar were a military brotherhood which focused upon the acquisition of wealth and knowledge. Although they had some religious overtones in their structure, their quest for knowledge ultimately made them a secular organization. I think that they would have been a more theocratic organization if they had a greater interest in wealth and power, since the church of that era was primarily involved in control of gold and land.}
{126}{}{And how does this relate to the Brotherhood?}
{127}{}{We must understand our past if we are to recognize our directions for the future... but I'm sure you wouldn't understand that.}
