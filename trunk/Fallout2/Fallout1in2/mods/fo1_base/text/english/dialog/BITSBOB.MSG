{100}{}{You see: Bob, proprietor of Bob's Iguana Bits.}
{101}{}{Okay, okay, I've got your money.}
{102}{}{I've got more expenses. I need to increase the payment.}
{103}{}{Screw this. I want ALL of your money, NOW, or you're a dead Bob.}
{104}{}{I can't take the heat. I'm calling off the payments.}
{105}{}{I want information on Decker.}
{106}{}{I want information on Doc Morbid.}
{107}{}{Gimme an iguana on a stick.}
{108}{}{I'm sorry, but I ain't payin' no more. Do what you want with me.}
{109}{}{Bob, I thought we were pals! In fact, I was thinking about giving you a promotion in my organization. Instead, you betray me. This is very disappointing...}
{110}{}{Bob, why should I take no for an answer? Especially from a scumbag like you?}
{111}{}{Glad to see you're standing up for yourself.}
{112}{}{Your reputation is history, Bob. Hi-sto-ree!}
{113}{}{Fine, I'll decide what to do with you later.}
{114}{}{Well, it was nice knowing you Bob. Say 'hi' to Satan for me.}
{115}{}{What are you doing back so soon? It ain't time for the payment.}
{116}{}{You've got a lot of nerve showing your face around here. Get lost!}
{117}{}{Hey, I don't want any trouble!}
{118}{}{Hi! Welcome to Bob's Iguana Bits, the family eating place. May I take your order?}
{119}{}{Fuck you.}
{120}{}{You are? Well, okay...}
{121}{}{He's a mean son of a bitch. You don't want to mess with him. Anything else?}
{122}{}{Fine. What do you want me to pay?}
{123}{}{I want }
{124}{}{ caps every five days.}
{125}{}{Doc Morbid? All I know is that he's up around Junktown and he's the cheapest source of food I could find. That's all!}
{126}{}{Let's see what I've got in stock.}
{127}{}{I've got a whole iguana for twenty bucks.}
{128}{}{I've got prime cut select for eight bucks.}
{129}{}{I'll take one of the real ones.}
{130}{}{Nothing for me right now. I'm on a diet.}
{131}{}{I'll take one of the prime cuts.}
{132}{}{I could go for some prime cut right now. I'll even pay for it.}
{133}{}{Uhh... Me no hungry now.}
{134}{}{Fine! Take your money and get out!}
{135}{}{You can stick it! I ain't ever payin' you! Get lost!}
{136}{}{Yeah, sure. Why don't you find someone else to screw over.}
{137}{}{You can't throw crap without getting some of it on your fingers. Get out of here!}
{138}{}{Sure you will. Get lost!}
{139}{}{Sorry. We're all out of iguana.}
{140}{}{Sure. All I got is the whole iguanas at the moment. Thirty bucks each. You won't find a better roasted iguana in the wastes, I guarantee it!}
{141}{}{We only have prime cut select. It tastes great, though. Eight bucks each.}
{142}{}{Sure. We got whole iguana on a stick for twenty bucks, and our prime cut pieces for eight bucks.}
{143}{}{I'll take a whole iguana.}
{144}{}{I'll take your prime cut.}
{145}{}{You know, I hear your prime cut tastes like chicken. Do you like eating cowardly guys?}
{146}{}{No sissy portions! Me want all iguana! Ugh!}
{147}{}{Hmm, smell good! Me want prime!}
{148}{}{Never seen any of them around here. Water Merchants don't need 'em.}
{149}{}{Water Merchants?}
{150}{}{Mr. Decker is a distinguished businessman in a less than distinguished business. Anything else?}
{151}{}{Um... Okay...}
{152}{}{What kind of business?}
{153}{}{What are you talking about?}
{154}{}{Your secret ingredients. How fresh does the corpse have to be before it develops a bitter aftertaste? Do you use mutants, humans, or a mix?}
{155}{}{I found an invoice in Doc Morbid's lair. An invoice for dead bodies...}
{156}{}{If you've got memory loss, I can talk to the sheriff instead.}
{157}{}{Prime Cut Select is made of people!!!! It's made of people!!!}
{158}{}{Nothing. Sorry to bring it up. Now is there anything else I can do for you?}
{159}{}{Well, he's dead now, and my cash flow has increased because of it.}
{160}{}{Someone killed Decker. We're in mourning. *snicker*}
{161}{}{Someone shot Sheriff Greene. Don't know about the deputy, though.}
{162}{}{Daren Hightower was murdered. And all that money couldn't save him. Ironic, ain't it?}
{163}{}{Someone stole a necklace from the Hightowers. Man, did they ever make a big mistake. They're dead for sure!}
{164}{}{Someone killed Jain over at the Cathedral. I hear she was a real pain in the butt!}
{165}{}{Well, the only new thing is that the Children of the Cathedral has taken over the hospital. It's pretty boring around here lately.}
{166}{}{Anything else?}
{167}{}{Man, I'm gonna be out of business in a week. Anything else, oh high and mighty?}
{168}{}{I don't like your attitude.}
{169}{}{Sorry, you can't afford one.}
{170}{}{One whole iguana coming up! Anything else?}
{171}{}{You know what they're made from and you still want one? You make Decker look like a charity worker! Anything else?}
{172}{}{I don't like your attitude.}
{173}{}{Sorry, you can't afford one.}
{174}{}{One prime cut select, coming up! Anything else?}
{175}{}{Smart decision. You could stand to lose a few pounds.}
{176}{}{Wh...what?! Oh, I see, you're joking...}
{177}{}{Of course I am...}
{178}{}{No, I'm not. I'm going to see that you pay for your crime.}
{179}{}{No, I'm not. And I want a piece of the action.}
{180}{}{You must be new in town if you're asking me about the Water Merchants. Water is life, and you don't get much more powerful than life and death.}
{181}{}{Who's in charge of the Water Merchants?}
{182}{}{If there's anything that involves misery and suffering in the Hub, Decker either controls it or wants to control it. Anything else?}
{183}{}{I don't know what you're talking about, and I don't appreciate your slander! I suggest you don't show your face around here again.}
{184}{}{Don't do that! Fine, I've been using some questionable portions, but it's not like I'm committing murder. Doc Morbid's stuff is already dead, isn't it?}
{185}{}{I'm sure it is, Bob. Have a nice day...}
{186}{}{Cannibalism is a crime against humanity, Bob. I'm going to see that you pay for it.}
{187}{}{Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. I don't care. I want a piece of the action.}
{188}{}{Not so loud! I don't need you saying that all over the Hub...}
{189}{}{I guess I was rude. Have a nice day...}
{190}{}{You know, the police station is just across the street. I really should take a little walk.}
{191}{}{I can get even louder. But I can also shut up. Noise is cheap, silence is expensive.}
{192}{}{How the hell am I gonna pay you if you eat all my stock? Fine! Have another iguana! I hope you choke on it!}
{193}{}{I don't like your attitude.}
{194}{}{Tough. You want money, I'll give it to you. You want food, I'll give it to you. You want to die, I'll arrange it. But 'like' ain't part of the equation.}
{195}{}{Nothing I can think of. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a business to run.}
{196}{}{Sorry, we're all out of iguana.}
{197}{}{We only have whole iguana on a stick. Twenty bucks.}
{198}{}{We only have prime cut select. Eight bucks.}
{199}{}{Again? Man, you must be hungry. We got whole iguana on a stick for twenty bucks, and our prime cut pieces for eight bucks.}
{200}{}{I'll take a whole iguana.}
{201}{}{I'll take your prime cut.}
{202}{}{You know, I hear your prime cut tastes like chicken. Do you like eating cowardly guys?}
{203}{}{No sissy portions! Me want all iguana! Ugh!}
{204}{}{Hmm, smell good! Me want prime!}
{205}{}{How the hell am I gonna pay you if you eat all my stock? Fine! Have another iguana! I hope you choke on it!}
{206}{}{I don't like your attitude.}
{207}{}{Uh, bye.}
{208}{}{Wait a minute. We've got to find a way to reach a mutual understanding!}
{209}{}{The only way you'll be able to keep me quiet is to kill me.}
{210}{}{Sorry, no deal.}
{211}{}{Fine. What can I get out of this?}
{212}{}{Fine. What do you want me to pay?}
{213}{}{I want }
{214}{}{50}
{215}{}{75}
{216}{}{100}
{217}{}{150}
{218}{}{200}
{219}{}{ caps every five days.}
{220}{}{I don't think I'll blackmail you. Carry on.}
{221}{}{I'd change your mind if I were you, friend. People have died for less in the Hub.}
{222}{}{Fine. It's a deal. }
# TRANSLATION NOTE: A number of caps is inserted between lines 222 and 223. The space at the end of line 222 is intentional!
{223}{}{ caps, due every five days. I guess I'll see you in five...}
{224}{}{No way I'm going for that. I can't afford more than what I'm paying you now.}
{225}{}{Too bad, Bob. I'd hate to start singing.}
{226}{}{Fine. We'll stay with the current arrangement... for now.}
{227}{}{Can you afford a funeral, Bob?}
{228}{}{Fine. Maybe it would be good if our paths didn't cross again.}
{229}{}{You may be a songbird, but I'm the golden goose. You ain't gonna sing, not when I'm the only goose you've got. Now get out!}
{230}{}{First sensible thing I've heard you say. Now get out!}
{231}{}{Gimme an iguana on a stick.}
{232}{}{What can you tell me about a Water Chip?}
{233}{}{What can you tell me about Decker?}
{234}{}{I think we need to talk about Doc Morbid and some of your secret ingredients.}
{235}{}{Do you know anything about the missing caravans?}
{236}{}{What, me trouble? What gives you that impression?}
{237}{}{Anything interesting happening in the Hub?}
{238}{}{Me hungry! Grrrrr!}
{239}{}{Terrible business. Those poor people. Oh, those poor people. Losing their lives in such a ghastly way! Is there anything else I can do for you? Like feed you, perhaps?}
{240}{}{Nothing, bye.}
{241}{}{Me go now.}
{242}{}{I don't have that kind of money. I'm barely making ends meet as it is.}

{243}{}{Thirty caps?! Are you kidding me?}
{244}{}{Look asshole, you're the one who ruined my profit margins. So if you don't like my prices, fuck off. There's plenty of other iguana stands around here. Oh wait, there isn't. Asshole.}
{245}{}{Terrible, thanks to you. Nobody likes snitches. Now, if you ain't here to buy anything, get out of my face.}
{246}{}{Whatever. Bye.}
{247}{}{Actually, come to think of it, I am pretty hungry.}

# 252 to 260 take place while Bob is in jail
{252}{}{What the hell are you doing here? You shut down my business and got a big fat reward I'm sure. So you're just here to gloat or what?}
{253}{}{Pretty much, yeah. How's business, Bob? [you wink at him]}
{254}{}{Nah, just checking to see how you're doing.}
{255}{}{Terrible, thanks to you. Nobody likes snitches. They might let me die in here for all I know.}
{256}{}{Serves you right.}
{257}{}{I could have them kill you right now, if you prefer that over waiting.}
{258}{}{I'll ask them if we can turn you into Iguana Bits after your execution!}
{259}{}{Whatever. Fuck off.}
{260}{}{Go away.}
