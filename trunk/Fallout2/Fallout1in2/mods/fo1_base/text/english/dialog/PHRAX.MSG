{107}{}{I just want a drink.}
{108}{}{Oh, ok.}
{109}{}{There ain't no drinks in that fridge. Keep away from it.}

{111}{}{You may be a Crypt, but this room is not for you. Don't mess with anything.}
{112}{}{You came to the wrong place at the wrong time.}
{113}{}{This room is not for you. Don't touch anything, or you'll answer to me.}
