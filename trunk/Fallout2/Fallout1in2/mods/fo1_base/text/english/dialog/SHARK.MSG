{100}{}{You see: Shark.}
{101}{}{You see a man with filed teeth.}
{102}{}{You bitch!}
{103}{}{Hey, fresh bait! So, what brings you in to our territory, chum? Here for a little fun? At your expense, of course.}
{104}{}{Actually, I'm here to kick butt and chew gum... you can guess the rest.}
{105}{}{What do you do for fun around here?}
{106}{}{Uh, I was just leaving. Bye.}
{107}{}{Just stopped by for a drink and some... entertainment.}
{108}{}{Glopf!}
{109}{}{We beat up posers like you!}
{110}{}{Not so fast! Nobody just walks into our place without payin' the pain tax. }
{111}{}{I think you'll do. Boys, grab her.}
{112}{}{Let me introduce you to the tax man. He's called Mr. Sledgehammer!}
{113}{}{I don't think so!}
{114}{}{Well, for this evening's entertainment, we've decided to thrash this place! Heh. Grab what you can carry and let's see some blood run, eh?}
{115}{}{Think I'll just grab a brew.}
{116}{}{Smash and grab? Count me in!}
{117}{}{Not tonight, I have a headache.}
{118}{}{Nah, I'd rather have something to eat... perhaps grilled shark!}
{119}{}{Ah, you loser. Go run back to your momma.}
{120}{}{You again? Geez, some people just don't learn!}
{121}{}{Just stopped in for a quick drink.}
{122}{}{Just leaving, never mind.}
{123}{}{Glorpf!}
{124}{}{Not a bad idea. Think I'll have one myself. Of course, you always have to wash a beer down with some bloodshed!}
{125}{}{I thought you'd get the picture by now to beat it. Guess I was wrong. Well, at least it'll be fun to beat you!}
{126}{}{We'll be back, old man. This isn't over.}
