{105}{}{Can you tell me a little bit about the area?}

{108}{}{My name is Christine, I live here with my husband Michael.}
{109}{}{Razor keeps track of most things with the Blades, and helps us organize ourselves.}
{110}{}{Michael and I just moved here, so I haven't seem much of the area. I've heard about a large church to the south, but it sounds mostly like rumors.}
{111}{}{Is there something else I should know?}
