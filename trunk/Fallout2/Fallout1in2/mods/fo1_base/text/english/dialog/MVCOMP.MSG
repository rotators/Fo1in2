{100}{}{This computer is labeled "Atomic Access Terminal".}
{101}{}{There are cables running from the access computer to the warhead behind it.}
{102}{}{You have armed the warhead. A timer displaying 4:00 has started a countdown.}
{103}{}{You have disarmed the nuclear warhead.}
{104}{}{BOOOOOOOOOM! [You have set off the nuke!]}
{105}{}{That doesn't seem to be working.}
{106}{}{The countdown is still going... maybe you should cut that red wire.}
{107}{}{Maybe you need to use the key also.}
{108}{}{This computer is equipped with a hardware locking device that prevents the arming of the bomb without the proper key.}
{109}{}{It is impossible to pick this heavily-secured lock.}
{110}{}{This computer cannot be repaired.}
{111}{}{That does nothing.}
{112}{}{You are not skilled enough to defeat the security mechanism.}
