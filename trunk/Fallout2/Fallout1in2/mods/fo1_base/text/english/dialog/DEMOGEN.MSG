{100}{}{The power generator has been sabotaged. It no longer functions.}
{101}{}{You see a power generator. It is the only source of power in Scrapheap.}
{102}{}{You clip some wires on the transformer. The power generator no longer functions.}
{103}{}{The cutters are of no further use.}
{104}{}{That item is useless on the generator.}
{105}{}{You notice nothing in particular about the generator.}
{106}{}{The generator itself looks fairly tamper-proof; however, you notice a set of wires between the transformer and the generator.}
{107}{}{You cannot see anything special about this large generator.}
{108}{}{You can determine nothing further about the generator.}
{109}{}{The wires could be repaired, but it may take a while, and there is no guarantee of success.}
{110}{}{You cannot see anything special about the damaged generator.}
{111}{}{You are unable to make any further repairs.}
{112}{}{There is no need to repair the power generator. It is functioning perfectly.}
{113}{}{You are unable to repair the functioning generator.}
{114}{}{It takes several hours, but you fix the power generator. With the power restored, and the gangs gone, the townspeople are grateful. They give you some valuable information. Your task in Scrapheap is done. The mission to find the Water Chip still awaits.}
{115}{}{You cannot fix the generator. The people of Scrapheap will lead a poorer life without their power; but with the gangs gone, at least they will have a life. Your task in Scrapheap is done. The mission to find the Water Chip still awaits.}
{116}{}{Further tampering with the generator yields nothing.}
{117}{}{That skill has no effect on the generator.}
{118}{}{The generator is already running.}
{119}{}{You are unable to start the generator, because it is broken.}
