{100}{}{You see a Paladin.}
{101}{}{Sorry, can't talk, Initiate.}
{102}{}{Good day.}
{103}{}{Did you know you can survive for weeks without water in a suit of Power Armor?}
{104}{}{Don't you just love a good fight?}
{105}{}{I really like the new laser rifles, but the old laser pistols are my favorite.}
{106}{}{The night perimeter patrols are very dangerous. I wouldn't wander too far at night if I were you.}
{107}{}{Be careful, it's a deadly world out there.}
{108}{}{I think my armor has a spot on it!}
{109}{}{The Brotherhood is great. I haven't had any experience outside of it, but it couldn't possibly get better than this.}
{110}{}{Good day, Initiate.}
{111}{}{If you need anything, you should talk to Vree.}
{112}{}{Vree's right over there if you need to talk to someone.}
{113}{}{I've got to find time between the patrols and training to keep up with my studies. I think I'm getting a little rusty.}
{114}{}{You've got to keep your mind and body in top condition at all times, Initiate.}
{115}{}{Being a Paladin isn't just combat, my son.}
{116}{}{Being a Paladin isn't just combat, my lady.}
