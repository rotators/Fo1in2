{100}{}{You see the caravan leader.}
{101}{}{Well, here we are. Here's your payment of }
{102}{}{ caps. (He pulls out an old, dog-eared bag and gives you the caps) You'll get another }
{103}{}{ caps if you return with us to the Hub. We'll rest here for a while, but don't go too far or the caravan will leave without you.}
{104}{}{Aaa... Okay.}
{105}{}{How long before the caravan leaves?}
{106}{}{What can you tell me about Junktown?}
{107}{}{What can you tell me about L.A. Boneyard?}
{108}{}{What can you tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{109}{}{I don't know if you'll understand this, but we leave in two hours or whenever you're ready.}
{110}{}{Um...}
{111}{}{Hunh?}
{112}{}{go. Gud.}
{113}{}{Man, we're hiring dumb ones these days.}
{114}{}{We usually leave two hours after arrival. There's nothing here we haven't seen before, though, so if you want to leave earlier we're ready whenever you are.}
{115}{}{I think I'll take a look around before we go. See you later.}
{116}{}{Okay. Let's head back to the Hub. Nothing I want to see here either.}
{117}{}{What can you tell me about Junktown?}
{118}{}{What can you tell me about L.A. Boneyard?}
{119}{}{What can you tell me about the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{120}{}{Well, it's quite a bit like the Hub, really. It has its share of problems: gangs, thugs, thieves, you know... the usual stuff. All in all, it's my kind of town. [Laughs]}
{121}{}{How long before the caravan leaves?}
{122}{}{I think I'll take a look around before we go. See you later.}
{123}{}{This part of L.A. Boneyard is called Adytum. L.A. Boneyard is basically run by gangs. Kind of a rough area, so watch your step here. Adytum is run by the Regulators. They're trying to hold this place together in light of all the gang wars. They're understandably suspicious of strangers, so if you haven't spoken to them yet I suggest you do before you start wandering around.}
{124}{}{Empty}
{125}{}{How long before the caravan leaves?}
{126}{}{I think I'll take a look around before we go. See you later.}
{127}{}{Not much I can tell you about them. The Brotherhood keeps to themselves for the most part. A lot of people give them a bad rap, but from what I can tell they're good people. A little fanatical, maybe, but good folks.}
{128}{}{How long before the caravan leaves?}
{129}{}{I think I'll take a look around before we go. See you later.}
{130}{}{Are you ready to go?}
{131}{}{go!}
{132}{}{No. I'm still looking around.}
{133}{}{Yeah. We can go.}
{134}{}{This part of L.A. Boneyard is called Adytum. L.A. Boneyard is basically run by gangs. Kind of a rough area, so watch your step here.}
{135}{}{How long before the caravan leaves?}
{136}{}{I think I'll take a look around before we go. See you later.}
{137}{}{Okay. You made it. Here's your }
{138}{}{ caps. If you want more work, just go talk to the boss. I'd be more than happy to work with you again. I'll put in a good word for you with the boss. Take it easy.}
{139}{}{bY bY.}
{140}{}{See ya.}
{141}{}{Hey, how's it goin'?}
{142}{}{If you want more work, go check with the boss.}
{143}{}{You got somethin's wrong with you?}
{144}{}{You're a freakin' psycho!}
{145}{}{I'm not working with you!}
{146}{}{200}
{147}{}{400}
{148}{}{600}
{149}{}{What can you tell me about the Necropolis?}
{150}{}{Nasty freakin' place, man!}
{151}{}{The caravan has left.}
{200}{}{Hmmmpf...}
{201}{}{Hmm... I wish I could read.}
{300}{}{Mind your own business, would you?}
{400}{}{I'm not paid to talk.}
{501}{}{Care to tell me why you abandoned the fucking caravan?? I can't believe it! Lucky for you, they finished without yer sorry ass! Get out! I'm not paying you anything!}
{502}{}{I can't believe it! We've lost the whole caravan! Get out! I ain't paying you anything!}
{504}{}{Go to the boss and try to come up with a credible story for why you abandoned the fucking caravan. Maybe then you'll get yer money, but I doubt it.}
{505}{}{I can't believe it! We've lost the whole caravan! I ain't paying you anything. Get out of my face.}
{600}{}{Well, here we are. I can't pay you the normal rate, since we lost some of the caravan. Gotta cover our losses y'know. Here's your payment of }
{601}{}{ caps. (He pulls out an old, dog-eared bag and gives you the caps) You'll get another }
{602}{}{If you want more work, just go talk to the boss. I'd be okay working with you again. Take it easy.}
{603}{}{ caps. (He pulls out an old dog-eared bag and gives you the caps) }
{604}{}{Okay, you made it. I can't pay you anything since we lost the whole caravan. Gotta cover our losses y'know. I wish it could be different but that's the rules.}
{605}{}{Okay, you made it. I can't pay you anything since all of the brahmin died. You cost us a lot of money, bub. No brahmin, no caravan, no money. I hope they don't let you work with us again.}
