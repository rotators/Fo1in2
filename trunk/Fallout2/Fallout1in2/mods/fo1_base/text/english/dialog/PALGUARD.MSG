{100}{}{You see a Paladin guard.}
{101}{}{Pssst, see any good deals?}
{102}{}{Sorry, I'm on duty. Can't talk right now.}
{103}{}{What a nice day. I hope we don't have any attacks today.}
{104}{}{Some of these Caravan traders are a little strange.}
{105}{}{Good day.}
{106}{}{Hi there, good looking.}
{107}{}{Greetings, Initiate.}
{108}{}{If you have any questions about our order, you should talk to Cabbot, over by the door.}
{109}{}{Cabbot is the one you want to talk to; he's the young lad by the door.}
{110}{}{Pssst, see any good deals?}
{111}{}{If you're here to trade you're talking to the wrong person.}
{112}{}{What?}
{113}{}{Don't bother me, worm.}
{114}{}{Do I look like I'm interested in anything you might have to offer?}
{115}{}{Hmph. The nerve.}
{116}{}{Initiate, you should know better than to bother us while we're on watch.}
{117}{}{If you have any questions about the Order, you should talk to Cabbot, by the door.}
{118}{}{Initiate, shouldn't you be doing something useful?}
{119}{}{I don't think you should be here, stranger.}
