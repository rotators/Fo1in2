{100}{}{You see a vault-dweller.}
{101}{}{I can't believe that you betrayed us!}
{102}{}{Traitor!}
{103}{}{I hate you. Why did you ever come back?!}
{104}{}{I hope you choke on your vileness!}
{105}{}{}
{106}{}{}
{107}{}{}
{108}{}{}
{109}{}{Thank you for saving us.}
{110}{}{I was a little unsure that you could do it, but I trust you now.}
{111}{}{Thank you! Thank you!}
{112}{}{You are a hero. My little boy wants to be just like you when he grows up. I don't know if I like that.}
{113}{}{You are a heroine. My little girl wants to be just like you when she grows up. I don't know if I like that.}
{114}{}{You are a swell guy!}
{115}{}{You are a swell gal!}
{116}{}{Are you sure you need that in here?}
{117}{}{That's a weapon!}
{118}{}{Have you actually used that against someone?}
{119}{}{Why do you think it is necessary to carry a weapon in here?}
{120}{}{It's good to see you again.}
{121}{}{I'm glad you are doing well.}
{122}{}{You look okay to me. All those rumors must be untrue.}
{123}{}{Hi }
{124}{}{. Keep up the good work.}
{125}{}{I hope everything is going well out there. We sure could use the water.}
{126}{}{We are starting to run out of water. This is terrible!}
{127}{}{Please hurry and find that chip. We need you.}
{128}{}{I'm glad you are doing well. Keep up the good work.}
{129}{}{I hate to say this, but if you don't find the Water Chip soon, we're all going to die.}
{130}{}{My little one is always crying in the middle of the night for a drink of water and I can't give her anything.}
{131}{}{We're not going to make it, are we?}
{132}{}{The water rations are coming to an end.}
{133}{}{The hydroponics section has closed down now. It means our food supply is running out.}
{134}{}{Hmm. You still look human to me. It can't be all that bad outside.}
{135}{}{Hi }
{136}{}{.}
{137}{}{I hope you are doing well on your quest.}
{138}{}{See you around.}
{139}{}{Have you talked to the Overseer recently?}
{140}{}{The Overseer is very concerned about the status of your mission.}
{141}{}{You need to hurry. We can't afford any failure on your part.}
{142}{}{I hope you are doing the best you can.}
{143}{}{This is no time to rest, get back out there.}
{144}{}{This isn't what you are supposed to be doing, is it?}
{145}{}{We're going to die, and it's your fault.}
{146}{}{Don't just stand here, get back out there! Now!}
{147}{}{If we die, it will be your fault.}
{148}{}{The outside has corrupted you, hasn't it?}
{149}{}{Just leave me alone.}
{150}{}{I think you should leave me and my family alone, }
{151}{}{. It would be for the best.}
{152}{}{You should be ashamed of yourself.}
{153}{}{And to think that I used to like you.}
{154}{}{The vault-dweller refuses to talk to you.}
{155}{}{An empty stare meets your request to talk.}
{156}{}{I regret that we picked you to go outside.}
{157}{}{The water is foul, but your company is worse.}
{158}{}{Go away. Just leave. You can redeem yourself by finding that Water Chip.}
{159}{}{I hope you are satisfied.}
{160}{}{The vault-dweller refuses to talk to you.}
{161}{}{You caused this! You probably broke the Water Chip in the first place, too!}
{162}{}{I hate you. I really, really hate you.}
{163}{}{The vault-dweller just sobs great big tears.}
{164}{}{Your request to talk is met by a cold stare.}
{165}{}{Thank you.}
{166}{}{It's late. Come back some other time.}
{167}{}{The vault-dweller is resting.}
