{100}{}{You see a guard for the Children.}
{101}{}{Phillips! Let's take this guy out!}
{102}{}{Get outta my face!}
{103}{}{What do you want?}
{104}{}{Tell me about your work.}
{105}{}{What's this place about?}
{106}{}{You wouldn't know where I can find a Water Chip?}
{107}{}{What can you tell me about a man named Decker?}
{108}{}{Nice weapon you got there...}
{109}{}{Uh... milk.}
{110}{}{I'm a hired hand. If anyone bothers these space cadets, I kill em. You got a problem with that?}
{111}{}{So you're a bodyguard...}
{112}{}{Who hired you?}
{113}{}{Anything interesting happening in the Hub?}
{114}{}{What are you making?}
{115}{}{Yeah. A big problem.}
{116}{}{No problem, friend.}
{117}{}{Something called a Holy Flame. Don't listen to this bullshit, it'll rot your brain!}
{118}{}{What's your take on this Holy Flame?}
{119}{}{Man, are these people ever stupid!}
{120}{}{Anything interesting happening in the Hub?}
{121}{}{Where did these guys come from?}
{122}{}{Water Chip? Do you mean like ice chips? Up in the mountains, maybe.}
{123}{}{No, I mean the computer chip to control a water purification system.}
{124}{}{Not that kind of chip, you moron!}
{125}{}{Uh thanks. I think.}
{126}{}{You ever been to the mountains?}
{127}{}{Yeah, I heard about him. He's a real bastard, but he pays his bills. Phillips worked for him a few times.}
{128}{}{So you think he's a creep?}
{129}{}{Phillips?}
{130}{}{Would you take a job from him.}
{131}{}{Thanks!}
{132}{}{Yeah, this is the only one I'd want in a fire fight. What can I do for you?}
{133}{}{Where can a guy go here to get some quality weapons?}
{134}{}{What's up with these Cathedral guys?}
{135}{}{Where can a guy go to find action around here?}
{136}{}{You wouldn't know where I can find a Water Chip?}
{137}{}{What can you tell me about a man named Decker?}
{138}{}{Sorry pal, but I'm on duty. No small talk.}
{139}{}{Get the hell out of my face before I kill you.}
{140}{}{Way to go, Rocket Scientist! Who else could I be, Doc Morbid? Jeez!}
{141}{}{The priest bitch. Who else did you think? Jeez!}
{142}{}{I hate to admit it pal, but I've been out of the loop for weeks. You better ask someone else.}
{143}{}{Room and board and not much else. These religious types are cheap!}
{144}{}{Then let's solve it!}
{145}{}{Fine. Because nobody likes a problem around here.}
{146}{}{It's gotta be a scam. Nobody's really dumb enough to believe all this religious shit. Could they?}
{147}{}{Yeah. It's a good thing that they aren't paying me to agree with them. Holy Flame, my ass!}
{148}{}{I dunno. I can tell you one thing, whatever you can say about the religion, they're not amateurs. They came in and organized this place like clockwork. This isn't just another band of mindless zombies.}
{149}{}{Jeez, I thought only Vaults used that sort of crap!}
{150}{}{Watch your mouth, asshole. These people may believe in peace and love, but I don't!}
{151}{}{No problem.}
{152}{}{Nah. The higher you climb, the worse the radiation gets.}
{153}{}{Uh, if you like psychotic, stone cold ruthless bastards, then he's the man.}
{154}{}{My partner. The guy who's guarding Jain.}
{155}{}{It depends on how much risk you like. My life's been kinda busy lately, so I came here to lie low. But if you like action, sure. Just don't screw up or you're dead, that's all.}
{156}{}{I hear the Water Merchants are always packing the best shit. But people will say anything about the Water Merchants. It ain't here among this crowd, that's for damn sure.}
{157}{}{I been trying to get a good read on these guys for weeks. At first I thought they were fools, but now... I ain't sure. They're organized, and they've got a plan. I can smell it!}
{158}{}{I hear Decker's got some action, but man, it's shitty work and if you screw up, you're as good as dead.}
{159}{}{Water purification chip? You don't use well water? Good lord! I heard tell of a Vault near Shady Sands where you might find one, but that place is completely caved in. I don't think I can help you.}
{160}{}{Can't talk. The boss don't like it. Sorry.}
{161}{}{Hey, you!}
{162}{}{Hey! What do you think you're doing!}
{163}{}{Why the lock?}
{164}{}{Hey, I'm backing off!}
{165}{}{Can you give me a hand with this door? It's stuck!}
{166}{}{You saw me! Too bad for you...}
{167}{}{None of your business! Get outta here!}
{168}{}{Good! Now get outta here!}
{169}{}{Get lost! If you pull this sort of shit again, I'll kill you personally!}
{170}{}{We ain't supposed to talk to you. On your way, pal.}
{171}{}{Hey! What do you think you're doing?}
{172}{}{Why the lock?}
{173}{}{Hey, I'm backing off!}
{174}{}{Can you give me a hand with this door? It's stuck!}
{175}{}{You saw me! Too bad for you...}
{176}{}{None of your business! Get outta here!}
{177}{}{Good! Now get outta here!}
{178}{}{Get lost! If you pull this sort of shit again, I'll kill you personally!}
