;This file handles modifications to perks and traits
;When adding extra perks to a mod, it's advisable to use
; the fake perk scripting functions rather than make modifications
; in this file, as some perks have hardcoded effects which may
; catch you out
;Since traits need to be picked before any scripts run, they
; have an additional NoHardcode option in this file which can
; be used to remove their hardcoded effects, and add new stat/skill effects

;Name=The name of the perk (max 63 characters)
;Desc=The description of the perk (max 255 characters)
;Image=The line number (0-indexed) of the corresponding FRM in skilldex.lst
;Ranks=The number of perk levels
;Level=The minimum required level
;Type=If 0, the perk checks only Skill1 for skill requirements; if 1, it checks
; Skill1 or Skill2; if 2, it checks both Skill1 and Skill2
;Stat=The modified stat or -1 if you don't want to change any stats
;StatMag=The increased/decreased value to the modified stat
;Skill1=The first skill (or -1 for none) to check, but if you set a specific bit
; (67108864 or 0x4000000), it checks GVAR. For example, if Skill1=67108864, then
; the perk will check GVAR_PLAYER_REPUTATION (67108864 + 0) on Skill1Mag value
;Skill1Mag=Positive value is used as the minimum requirements of the first
; skill/GVAR, and a negative value is interpreted as the maximum requirement.
; For example, with Skill1=0 and Skill1Mag=100, if player has small guns skill
; >= 100 and meets all other requirements, the perk will be available in the
; selection window; with Skill1=1 and Skill1Mag=-120, the perk will not be
; available if player has big guns skill >= 120
;Skill2=The second skill/GVAR (or -1 for none) to check
;Skill2Mag=Same as Skill1Mag, but for Skill2
;STR-LCK=Positive values are used as minimum requirements of SPECIAL stats, and
; negative values are interpreted as maximum requirements. For some special
; perks processed by the engine (e.g. PERK_armor_powered and PERK_armor_combat),
; the values are not used as requirements but to add to corresponding SPECIAL
; stats

;If the value is set to -99999, the variable will be ignored (similar to comment out that line)

;You can add simple extra perks with ID numbers from 119 to 255
; that do not require using scripting functions to change player stats, and can also be used for Armor perks
;These parameters are only for extra perks
;Stat1-Stat2 = same as Stat
;Stat1Mag-Stat2Mag = same as StatMag
;Skill3-Skill5 = The skill to be modified (or -1 for none)
;Skill3Mod-Skill5Mod = The increased/decreased value to the modified skill
