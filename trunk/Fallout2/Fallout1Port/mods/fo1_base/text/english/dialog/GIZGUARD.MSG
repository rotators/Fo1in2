{105}{}{No sneaking around in here!}
{106}{}{Hey, you! Quit trying to hide, or get out!}
{107}{}{What?}
{108}{}{Hey, can I ask you a few questions?}
{109}{}{Can you spare a few caps?}
{110}{}{Never mind, sorry.}
{111}{}{Uuuh?}
{112}{}{I'm on duty. Make it quick.}
{113}{}{No. Go away.}
{114}{}{Can you tell me about your boss?}
{115}{}{What else is there around this town?}
{116}{}{What are you, stupid? Go away.}
{117}{}{No. Go beg somewhere else.}
{118}{}{Buzz off.}
{119}{}{We don't have a use for paupers here.}
{120}{}{Gizmo's a fair man. Pay's good, work's easy. Don't make trouble and everyone will be happy.}

{122}{}{Why don't you go shopping at Killian's? His store is southeast of here. Now beat it.}
{123}{}{Talk to the dealers.}
{124}{}{Hey, if you wanna have a little fun, stop by the Crash House and ask for Sinthia. She's worth it.}
