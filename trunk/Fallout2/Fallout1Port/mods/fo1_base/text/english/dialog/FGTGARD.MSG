{100}{}{You see a guard for the Far Go Traders.}
{101}{}{Those damn Water Merchants are ripp'n us all off.}
{102}{}{Be sure to pay the FLC on time, they're a deadly lot.}
{103}{}{You'll want to talk to Rutger.}
{104}{}{Far Go Traders are the best.}

{106}{}{Hmm, I've a craving for some iguana on a stick.}
{107}{}{Who the hell is stealing our caravans?}
{108}{}{My brother was on the last caravan that disappeared.}
{109}{}{Those water misers are responsible, I know it.}
{110}{}{Mutants took the caravans I hear. Terrible thing.}
{111}{}{Heard you say it was Super Mutants. Hope you made 'em pay.}
{112}{}{I thought the Deathclaw was responsible. Damn mutants!}
{113}{}{We're closed. Come back in the morning.}
{114}{}{Hey, this isn't the Falcon. Get the hell out.}
{115}{}{What are you? Some kind of a skag? Get the hell out.}
{116}{}{Beat it!}
{117}{}{We're only open during the day.}
{118}{}{Are you on drugs? Get lost.}
{119}{}{You need to come back in the morning.}
