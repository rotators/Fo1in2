{100}{}{You see the Master of the Super Mutants.}
{101}{Mast00}{So, what shall it be? Do you join the Unity or do you die here? Join! Die! Join! Die!}
{102}{}{I can't win. I'll join you.}
{103}{}{If you can prove to me that your Unity is the best course for humanity, then I will help you.}
{104}{}{How about you die, then I leave?}
{105}{}{Oh, there will be death today, but not mine. I've got a plan.}
{106}{}{Ungh.. wuh?}## "Ugh. Lee."
{107}{Mast01}{Excellent. Your talents will be useful. But first, you must tell me everything about your Vault.}
{108}{}{Why?}
{109}{}{Okay. I'll tell you everything you want to know.}
{110}{Mast02}{I will conquer it and turn all those pure strain humans into mutants. They will give me the army I need to bring peace to the entire wasteland.}
{111}{}{Sorry, I don't like that plan much.}
{112}{}{Sounds reasonable. Let's do it.}
{113}{Mast03}{So be it. You've dug your own grave. Grave! Grave!}
{114}{Mast04}{I don't have to prove anything to you! Prove.}
{115}{}{Your ego demands you tell me. All villains have this strange urge to explain everything.}
{116}{}{I can't know you represent the best future, unless you prove it to me.}
{117}{Mast05}{Very demanding for one in your tenuous position. But I can respect your needs.}
{118}{}{So tell me.}
{119}{Mast06}{The Unity will bring about the master race. Master! Master! One able to survive, or even thrive, in the wasteland. As long as there are differences, we will tear ourselves apart fighting each other. We need one race. Race! Race! One goal. Goal! Goal! One people... to move forward to our destiny. Destiny.}
{120}{}{That race being the mutants, of course.}
{121}{}{I hope we won't end up looking like you.}
{122}{Mast07}{Of course. Mutants are best equipped to deal with the world today. Who else? The ghouls. Please. Normals. They brought nuclear death to us all. This will be the age of mutants. Mutants.}
{123}{}{You mean to change all the others into mutants, as well.}
{124}{}{You're such a bigot.}
{125}{}{What about those who oppose you?}
{126}{Mast08}{All that resist, yes. All those that are required for the Unity as well. The remainder will be allowed to live out their days, but under Unity control and protection. But none shall breed, for they will be the last of their race.}
{127}{}{You've got a problem with your master plan.}
{128}{}{Sounds like you've got it under control. I'll join up.}
{129}{}{I think everyone here is nuts - you most of all. I need to stop you right now.}
{130}{Mast09}{And what is that?}
{131}{}{You didn't take into account me! I'm stopping you right here, right now!}
{132}{}{You can't possibly take on the entire world.}
{133}{}{I happen to know that your mutants are sterile.}
{134}{Mast10}{I'm not after the world, yet. When I turn your fellow vault-dwellers into mutants, my forces will be too strong for any to stand against! But don't worry, you won't care. Care! Care!}
{135}{Mast11}{Preposterous! The FEV-2 virus doesn't destroy the reproductive organs of those it mutates.}
{136}{}{Perhaps the virus didn't sterilize people once, but it does now.}
{137}{}{Have you talked to any of your mutants about this?}
{138}{}{Maybe it's all that extra radiation.}
{139}{Mast12}{Do you have proof?}
{140}{}{Of course, I do! Here it is... }
{141}{}{Take my word for it, it happens.}
{142}{}{Ask your own mutants.}
{143}{Mast13}{This proves nothing! You will pay for your insolence. Pay!}
{144}{}{I must digest this information. One moment.}
{145}{Mast14}{I must digest this information. One moment... I understand now. You made a clever forgery. You made this up to fool me. Fool! Me!}
{146}{}{What!? I don't understand, I thought it was correct!}
{147}{}{You're lying! You're denying the facts in front of you!}
{148}{Mast16}{You will pay for what you have done! Pay! Done.}
{149}{Mast17}{But it cannot be. This would mean that all my work has been for nothing. Everything that I have tried to... a failure! It can't be. Be. Be. Be.}
{150}{}{Sorry, this isn't an option for you. Your race will die out after this generation.}
{151}{}{Maybe there is something that can be done. Perhaps you need more test subjects.}
{152}{Mast18}{Yes. More subjects. I think I shall start with you. Do! Do!}
{153}{Mast19}{I... don't think that I can continue. Continue? To have done the things I have done in the name of progress and healing. It was madness. I can see that now. Madness. Madness? There is no hope. Leave now, leave while you still have hope... }
{154}{Mast20}{I believe I shall. Don't move.}
{155}{Mast21}{My scientists assure me that nothing is wrong. What do you say to that? Say! Say!}
{156}{}{Did you think to ask a female mutant?}
{157}{}{Ask one of your Lieutenants.}
{158}{}{They're afraid of you. You think they'll tell you the truth?}
{159}{Mast22}{One moment. He cannot be reached. He must be dead and I can guess who killed him. Killed! Kill!}
{160}{Mast23}{He denies everything. And he says he knows who started this rumor... }
{161}{Mast24}{I think I know who the liar is. Liar!}
{162}{Mast25}{Reasonable. One moment. Are you sure? What about the other females? It cannot be. Be.}
{163}{}{Sorry, your race is doomed.}
{164}{}{Excuse me while I gloat... Told ya so!}
{165}{Mast26}{Without any proof, I'm afraid I can't believe you. Now, you will join my army as a mutant or you will die! Die! Join!}
{166}{}{Better dead than like you.}
{167}{}{It means giving up everything I know, but I'll join.}
{168}{Mast27}{Your humor will not save you now. Do you accept my offer, or not? Not! Accept!}
{169}{}{Not.}
{170}{}{Okay, it's better than dying... }
{171}{Mast28}{Radiation has no effect on us. The Forced Evolutionary Virus makes us immune. Your argument is weak, and so are you.}
{172}{Mast29}{Oh, I think you are wrong. But just to be sure, I will order this matter researched. After I have taken care of you. Care. Care!}
{173}{Mast30}{My only problem is you. Now, will you work for the Unity, or not?}
{174}{}{Not.}
{175}{}{Sure.}
{176}{Mast31}{They will be punished for their insolence.}
{177}{}{You mean to kill them all?}
{178}{}{Then I must stop you now!}
{179}{Mast32}{Of course not. Most will be offered a chance to become a mutant. Those who deny this opportunity will be sterilized and let go. Those that resist will be executed.}
{180}{}{You are one sick puppy. Time to put you down.}
{181}{}{Hmm, I'm not big on being executed... I'm joining.}
{182}{Mast33}{We are all biased, are we not? We each care more about our individual communities than other people. We haven't changed, and I'll tell you something else... }
{183}{}{What's that?}
{184}{Mast34}{We won't change. Not unless we are of one people. One. One. One. One race. One. One. One. The Unity will allow us to move beyond these petty concerns and deal with the major problems at hand. You want to be a part of that, don't you? Part. Don't.}
{185}{}{You've convinced me. I'll join the Unity.}
{186}{}{I want a part of you... your head!}
{187}{Mast35}{Of course! The mutants will survive! The mutants will rebuild this world! And only as a mutant, will you be allowed to live! Live. Die!}
{188}{}{Live!}
{189}{}{Die!}
{190}{}{All you care about is your mutants and their Unity.}
{191}{Mast36}{I am no villain. You have no idea what I, or the Unity is about.}
{192}{}{Then tell me what you are about.}
{193}{}{You are a villain. You're just denying your inner feelings.}
{194}{Mast37}{I don't have to prove myself to you. Using your logic, that must, prove I am not a villain. It would be a hopeless cause to explain it to you. }
{195}{Mast38}{Oh? Please, what sort of plan might that be?}
{196}{}{I'm going to set off a nuclear device in this Vault. It will explode shortly, taking you all to hell!}
{197}{}{I'll kill you and that'll make it difficult for you to continue, right?}
{198}{}{I convinced the Brotherhood of Steel to invade this place if I was captured and not set free. They will be here any moment.}
{199}{Mast39}{You might be telling the truth. It doesn't matter, but I will let you go for now.}
{200}{Mast40}{You are lying. It will be the last lie that you tell. }
{201}{Mast41}{One moment while I check out your story. You might be telling the truth. Guards! Take this human to the reactor core. Deal with the problem before it's too late.}
{202}{Mast42}{I doubt even the FEV will help you. Why am I talking? It's unlikely you even understand... }
{203}{Mast43}{You must be joking. }
{204}{Mast44}{My patience is almost at an end with you. Now, will you join the Unity or not? Join. Not!}
{205}{}{Yes.}
{206}{}{Not.}
{207}{Mast45}{Fine. Then you can die here and now!}
{208}{Mast46}{You have disarmed the device. Excellent. Tell me, is there anything you wanted to say before I kill you?}
{209}{}{Yes, can I join up with you now?}
{210}{}{Even dead, I'll still look better than you.}
{211}{Mast47}{No. No. No. No.}
{212}{Mast200}{I am the Master. I don't have to answer to you.}
{213}{Mast201}{I am not here to answer your questions. You are here to answer mine.}
{214}{Mast202}{Once I have the location of your Vault, I will fulfill my destiny! Destiny! Destiny! Destiny!}
{215}{Mast203}{You think you can destroy me!? Destroy! Me?}
{300}{}{Duh!}
