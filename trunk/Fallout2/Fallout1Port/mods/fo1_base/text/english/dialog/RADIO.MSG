## 103 - Uh, nothing is wrong here. We're fine, uh, how are you?

{103}{}{Uhhh, everything's under control, situation normal. Nothing is wrong here. We had a slight... weapons malfunction. But everything's perfectly alright now.  We're all fine, here, now. How are you?}

{119}{}{There is only static on the radio.}
{120}{}{You hear some chatter on the radio. You listen for a while, but discover nothing of importance.}
{121}{}{The radio has a red blinking light. You hear a high-pitched squealing over the radio speaker.}
{122}{}{It sounds like encrypted audio.}
{123}{}{You send the command code to toggle the force field settings.}

{124}{}{You hear some chatter on the radio. You listen for a while, but discover nothing of importance.}
{125}{}{The radio is not functioning.}

{127}{}{There is nothing but the squeal of encrypted data over the radio.}
{128}{}{[Squeal-snick-pop] Command here, go ahead patrol.}
{129}{}{Ack!}
