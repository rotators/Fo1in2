{100}{}{You see a tough-looking desert bandit. Based on how the others look at him, he must have some position of importance or authority.}
{101}{}{Greetings! I am Petrox. I am one of Garl's lead raiders. Who are you?}
{102}{}{I'm }
{103}{}{. What do you do as a raider?}
{104}{}{My name is unimportant at the moment. Can you tell me something about your camp?}
{105}{}{Hroo?}
{106}{}{As a raider, I get to travel to many parts of the wasteland. In my travels, I get supplies for the camp.}
{107}{}{In other words, you steal from the people you go to.}
{108}{}{Hey, that's really great of you. I'm sure that Garl is pleased with you.}
{109}{}{What places have you been to?}
{110}{}{Well, it's nice that you think that you are so important that you don't need a name to go around here. But, I will at least tell you a little about us. We are the toughest people in the wastelands. No one can stand against us. Not even those wimps from Shady Sands or Junktown.}
{111}{}{What about Shady Sands?}
{112}{}{What is Junktown?}
{113}{}{I am sorry, but I don't have time to waste on those who are slow. Goodbye.}
{114}{}{We never steal. We just take the extra that others have and redistribute it amongst ourselves.}
{115}{}{So, basically, you steal it.}
{116}{}{That sounds like a really great idea.}
{117}{}{I've been to many places in the wastelands. The closest places that I've been to are Shady Sands and Junktown. Not much happens in those places, but they are always full of information and supplies.}
{118}{}{Tell me about Shady Sands.}
{119}{}{Tell me about Junktown.}
{120}{}{You are starting to become annoying now. I think I will end that slight problem.}
{121}{}{Shady Sands is a fertile community. They are happy to, um, share their bounty with us.}
{122}{}{What can you tell me about Junktown?}
{123}{}{Junktown is a little bit south of here. They have many good women.}
{124}{}{Junktown is a little bit south of here. They have many good women. Say... I can show you around sometime, maybe we can get to know each other better... whaddya say?}
{125}{}{No thanks, maybe some other time.}
{126}{}{Sure, maybe later.}
{127}{}{Well, maybe later.}
{128}{}{I have told you all that I am permitted. Please go.}
