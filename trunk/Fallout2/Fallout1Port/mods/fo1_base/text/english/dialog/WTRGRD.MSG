{100}{}{You see the water guard.}
{101}{}{Hello, }
{102}{}{. }
{103}{}{Hello. How are you doing?}
{104}{}{Gahh!}
{105}{}{Well Gahh! back to you... I'm sorry that you never learned to speak. We might have been good friends.}
{106}{}{Ouph.}
{107}{}{I'm not feeling very well. Someone cracked my head with a big pipe. I went to the medic but my head still hurts. Sure hope someone catches the jerk that hit me.}
{108}{}{Why did they do that?}
{109}{}{Guck.}
{110}{}{Well, they attacked me while I was here pretty late one night. Usually I go home by eight or so, but I was staying late since someone had some water stolen and I was checking our supplies. Next thing I know, I wake up in the med-lab with a big bump on my head. Things are getting crazy around here. Someone is going to get killed for water soon and I don't know what we can do about it.}
{111}{}{I'll see what I can do.}
{112}{}{Sorry. I hope you feel better soon.}
{113}{}{Here's your water.}
{114}{}{Here's your ration for today.}
{115}{}{Hey! What do you think you're doing?!?}
{116}{}{Please don't take so many supplies. We need those.}
{117}{}{You log your reports in the library computer system. You should return to the Overseer to finalize your progress.}

{120}{}{Hi. How have things been lately?}
{121}{}{Say, what are you doing here?}
{122}{}{Well, everyone's pretty nervous, of course, but we haven't had too much trouble. I hope you find a new chip soon.}
{123}{}{I hand out the water rations, of course. And I make sure that nobody tries to take more water than their share, though I don't think we'll have any trouble.}
{124}{}{Hmm. Well, keep up the good work.}
{125}{}{You too. I hope you find that chip soon so we can all go back to a normal life.}
{126}{}{You're welcome to take supplies if you need them, since your job is so important, but please don't take too much. We don't have much left.}
{127}{}{Can I take some supplies?}
