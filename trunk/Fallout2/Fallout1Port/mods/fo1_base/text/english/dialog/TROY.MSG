{100}{}{You see: Troy.}
{101}{}{Congratulations, human. You've been selected to join an elite band of worshippers. Follow me.}
{102}{}{This wouldn't happen to have anything to do with the rumors of a Super Mutant army running amok?}
{103}{}{Where are we going?}
{104}{}{What are you waiting for? Let's go!}
{105}{}{I don't think so.}
{106}{}{What's that terrible, disgusting corpse-like stench? Oh, it's you!}
{107}{}{Ruh?}
{108}{}{Follow me and you will find out. Or, to put it another way, follow me and live, fool!}
{109}{}{So if I don't go, I die? That doesn't sound very religious.}
{110}{}{You've convinced me. Let's start hoofing!}
{111}{}{I don't think so.}
{112}{}{Don't start what you can't finish, freak!}
{113}{}{Excellent!}
{114}{}{You should not play games with Lady Jain or the Children.}
{115}{}{You should not insult what you cannot kill. Now, shall you come with me and live, or do you wish to stay here and die?}
{116}{}{I'm coming!}
{117}{}{Forget it.}
{118}{}{Jeez, some mutants just can't take a joke!}
{119}{}{If I keep smelling you, I'll drop dead anyway!}
{120}{}{You stupid beast! Will you come or will you stay?}
{121}{}{Uh... Come!}
{122}{}{Uh... Me stay!}
{123}{}{Do not plague me with indecision! What is your answer, human?}
{124}{}{I'm coming with you. Let's go.}
{125}{}{Forget it.}
{126}{}{How dare you push me! No one tells me what to do!}
{127}{}{Insolent dog! You will die now!}
{128}{}{Do not plague me with your jests! What is your answer, human?}
{129}{}{I'm coming with you. Let's go.}
{130}{}{Forget it.}
{131}{}{Don't push me, pal. I'm still trying to think of a good smartass comeback... }
{132}{}{The mutant ignores you.}
