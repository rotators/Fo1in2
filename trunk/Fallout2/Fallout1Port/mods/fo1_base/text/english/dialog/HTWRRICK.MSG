{104}{}{Your head on a stick!}
{105}{}{Never mind.}
{106}{}{Get back over to the Eastside, you hop head!}
{107}{}{Wha?}
{108}{}{I go.}
{109}{}{Make it quick. I'm not supposed to be talking on the job.}
{110}{}{Where am I?}
{111}{}{What's your job?}
{112}{}{Sorry to bother you. Bye.}
{113}{}{You'd better watch your step and your mouth, punk!}
{114}{}{NO! You'd better watch it! I'm gonna' put a bullet in your head!}
{115}{}{You're not worth my time.}

{127}{}{Make me, you damn long-haired freak!}
{128}{}{After sundown nobody is allowed in this area. The other guards won't even give you a warning. If they catch you they'll attack. You'd better get back downtown while your head is still attached to your neck.}
