{101}{}{There are cables running from the access computer to the warhead behind it.}
{102}{}{You have armed the warhead. A timer displaying 4:00 has started a countdown.}
{103}{}{You have disarmed the nuclear warhead.}
{104}{}{BOOOOOOOOOM! [You have set off the nuke!]}
{105}{}{That doesn't seem to be working.}
{106}{}{The countdown is still going... maybe you should cut that red wire.}
{107}{}{Maybe you need to use the key also.}
{108}{}{This is a nuclear warhead. It is controlled by the computer attached by the cables.}
{109}{}{There is nothing on this nuclear warhead that needs repairing.}
{110}{}{There is nothing on this nuclear warhead that can be lockpicked.}
{111}{}{This is a very big trap that cannot be disarmed or armed from here.}
