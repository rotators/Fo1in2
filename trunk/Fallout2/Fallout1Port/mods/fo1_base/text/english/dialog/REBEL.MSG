{104}{}{}
{105}{}{Thank you for saving us.}
{106}{}{I was a little unsure that you could do it, but I trust you now.}
{107}{}{Thank you! Thank you!}
{108}{}{You are a hero. My little Bobby wants to be just like you when he grows up. I don't know if I like that.}
{109}{}{You are a heroine. My little Bobby wants to be just like you when he grows up. I don't know if I like that.}
{110}{}{You are a swell guy!}
{111}{}{You are a swell gal!}
{112}{}{Are you sure you need that in here?}
{113}{}{That's a weapon!}
{114}{}{Have you actually used that against someone?}
{115}{}{Why do you think it is necessary to carry a weapon in here?}
{116}{}{Hello! How goes the search?}
{117}{}{Pretty well.}
{118}{}{Not so good.}
{119}{}{Ugh.}
{120}{}{Well, that's good to hear. Keep up the good work, I guess.}
{121}{}{No problem.}
{122}{}{We knew that there was no hope. I don't think we'll get a new chip in time. I think that some of us should move outside before it's too late.}
{123}{}{I don't think that's a good idea.}
{124}{}{Hmm. That might be best.}
{125}{}{Please hurry.}
{126}{}{Don't worry, I'll find the chip.}
{127}{}{Maybe you should come to one of our meetings. Theresa has some good ideas. We meet in her room on the second level, at five o'clock each evening.}
{128}{}{I'll think about it.}
{129}{}{No thanks. I have work to do.}
{130}{}{That's what Theresa thinks. She's got it all worked out. We're thinking of leaving the Vault soon.}
{131}{}{Good luck.}
{132}{}{I don't think you should leave just yet.}
{133}{}{Why did the Overseer pick you? It's obvious you couldn't find your shoelaces, much less a new Water Chip. Oh well.}
{134}{}{Urgh.}
{135}{}{Don't you have a job to do? Hurry and find the chip!}
{136}{}{Don't tell me what to do, loser boy!}
{137}{}{Fine! Some people.}
{138}{}{Gdorf!}
{139}{}{You've sealed the fate of everyone in this Vault, traitor. I hope you are satisfied with yourself.}

{1003}{}{Vault}
{1100}{}{The Overseer just wants to keep everyone under his control in here. We need to go out into the world for ourselves.}
{1101}{}{The Vault has been our home, but it just won't last any longer. It's time to make a new home.}
