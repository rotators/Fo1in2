{100}{}{Decker has no wish to talk to you any more.}
{101}{}{You see: Decker.}
{102}{}{Decker is too busy to speak to you. Do your job and come back later.}
{103}{DECK_1}{So. You're looking for a job. How fortunate. I have one that needs doing. Ahh, but where are my manners? What's your name?}
{104}{}{I am }
{105}{}{.}
{106}{}{What business is it of yours?}
{107}{DECK_2}{Well, the pleasantries are now concluded. Do you wish to hear about the job?}
{108}{}{That's why I'm here.}
{109}{}{Not particularly.}
{110}{DECK_3}{Background: There's a certain merchant who's... how to phrase this... not cooperating fully with the Underground.}
{111}{}{And the job?}
{112}{DECK_4}{Quite simple. Hunt down the merchant and his wife and exterminate them. }
{113}{}{You mean kill them?}
{114}{}{How much for the job?}
{115}{}{I can't do that!}
{116}{DECK_5}{All a matter of semantics, but yes. Kill them. Will you take the job?}
{117}{}{Umm, sure - why not?}
{118}{}{No! That would be wrong!}
{119}{}{How much?}
{120}{DECK_6}{Oh, excellent. The standard pay is 500 scripts to open, and another 2500... to close.}
{121}{}{Where can I find this merchant?}
{122}{DECK_7}{They live in the Heights, on Barter Street and Thunder Avenue. Complete the job and return.}
{123}{}{Okay, I will.}
{124}{}{How will you know I killed them?}
{125}{}{I don't think so.}
{126}{DECK_8}{Quite excellent. My assistant will renumerate you on the way out. Please, close the door behind you.}
{127}{deck_9}{Trust me. I'll know.}
{128}{}{Okay, I'll do it.}
{129}{}{Pass.}
{130}{DECK_10}{I must confess feeling a bit... disappointed in you. But these things happen. You will remember this is confidential. Good day.}
{131}{DECK_11}{It's standard pay. 500 caps to start, another 2500 when the job is done. Will you do it?}
{132}{}{No, thanks.}
{133}{}{Yeah, I'll do it.}
{134}{DECK_12}{Very nice. The merchant lives in the Heights, on Barter Street and Thunder Avenue. Your initial pay will be handed to you on your way out.}
{135}{DECK_13}{Everything is my business in the Hub. Either tell me, or you may leave.}
{136}{}{My name is }
{137}{}{.}
{138}{}{I'm not telling you anything.}
{139}{DECK_14}{I see... My assistant will show you to the door.}
{140}{DECK_15}{I'm very proud of you. You're ruthless, an attribute I admire. Kane will give you your payment. I hope you're available in the future.}
{141}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
{142}{}{Thanks.}
{143}{DECK_16}{Under the circumstances, yes.}
{144}{}{What's in the Hub?}
{145}{}{Heard any rumors?}
{146}{}{Never mind.}
{147}{Deck_16b}{Keep it brief, please.}
{148}{DECK_17}{The Merchant Market is in the center of town, surrounded by a number of establishments. You have the Heights to the west, and Old Town to the east.}
{149}{}{What kind of establishments?}
{150}{}{Thanks for the information. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{151}{DECK_18}{You're in the Maltese Falcon. There's also the All-N-One Store, the Armory, the Friendly Lending Company, the police and, unfortunately, the Children of the Cathedral hospital.}
{152}{}{Doesn't sound like you're a fan of the Children. What's up?}
{153}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you some more questions?}
{154}{DECK_19}{They... encroach. Let's leave it at that, shall we?}
{155}{}{Okay. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{156}{DECK_20}{I'm not a tour guide. Go see for yourself.}
{157}{}{Can I ask some more questions?}
{158}{}{True. Tour guides would be much nicer.}
{159}{DECK_21}{No. Please get your payment and leave.}
{160}{DECK_22}{Pardon me? }
{161}{}{You heard me.}
{162}{}{Nothing. Can I ask you some more questions?}
{163}{DECK_23}{You are arrogant. My assistant will show you through... I mean... to the door.}
{164}{deck_24}{No.}
{165}{}{Well, can I ask you something else?}
{166}{}{You're a cranky guy.}
{167}{DECK_25}{Someone appears to be stealing whole caravans from the Far Go Traders. And the Thieves' Circle is causing their normal minor difficulties.}

{168}{}{}
{169}{}{Sure.}
{170}{}{No way in hell!}
{171}{DECK_27}{Excellent. You see, the last job I gave you was a test and you did exceedingly well. Now comes a job of importance.}
{172}{}{Which is?}
{173}{}{Sounds scary. I don't think I'm interested.}
{174}{DECK_28}{As you may know, the Children of the Cathedral have been gaining influence in this town, and frankly, I won't stand for it.}
{175}{}{So what do you want me to do?}
{176}{DECK_29}{A small matter. Kill the High Priestess, Jain. Once she's gone, this little nuisance will be ended. Interested?}
{177}{}{Absolutely.}
{178}{}{But that would be immoral!}
{179}{DECK_30}{I believe I'm beginning to like you. The pay is 1000 up front and 4000 upon completion. And trust me, I'll know when it's done.}
{180}{}{Okay.}
{181}{DECK_31}{Talk to Kane on your way out. He'll provide you with details.}
{182}{DECK_32}{And killing the merchant wasn't?}
{183}{}{Well, all right, I'll do it.}
{184}{}{I don't care. I won't do it.}
{185}{DECK_33}{The pay is 1000 in advance and 4000 upon... execution. And trust me, I'll know when it's over.}
{186}{}{Okay.}
# Line 187 has been changed due to gender issues. See 234-235.
{187}{}{}
{188}{DECK_35}{What a pity. Are you certain you won't even hear what the job is?}
{189}{}{Yep, I'm not gonna do it.}
{190}{}{Okay, what is it?}
{191}{DECK_36}{Then we have nothing more to discuss.}
{192}{DECK_37}{Exceptional job. I believe the religious faction shall not interfere anymore. Speak with Kane for your reward. My thanks - and I will certainly keep you in mind in the future.}
{193}{DECK_38}{Put that down.}
{194}{DECK_39}{I am quite a patient man, but even I have limits. Kane, teach this simpleton a lesson.}
{195}{DECK_40}{Stop that.}
{196}{DECK_42}{Talk to Kane about that. He can tell you more.}
{197}{DECK_43}{As I said...}
{198}{DECK_44}{Like I said...}
{199}{DECK_45}{I already told you...}
{200}{DECK_46}{Weren't you listening to me? I said...}
{201}{DECK_47}{Be advised; I am unaccustomed to repeating myself.}
{202}{DECK_48}{I will not say that again.}
{203}{DECK_49}{You have no need to know anything else about me.}
{204}{DECK_50}{Most people do not bandy the name of my organization around lightly. We control the Hub.}
{205}{DECK_51}{My mother, finest woman I've ever known, gave me the idea for this, the finest entertainment establishment in all the Hub.}
{206}{DECK_52}{They steal from the merchants and give to the poor, or some such nonsense. They are inconsequential to me. That old mutant, Harold would know more.}
{207}{DECK_53}{He's the head of the police. Nice guy, if you like the straight arrow, honest type. Not like his father; now there was a loyal man.}
{208}{DECK_54}{Harold's been around for some time. He's over in Old Town. A good source for certain types of information.}
{209}{DECK_55}{They control the water. Go to the south end of the Merchant Market, you'll find them there.}
{210}{DECK_56}{He's the head of the Water Merchants.}
{211}{DECK_57}{They used to control the hospital until the Children took over. Now they sit and brood in their warehouse - very strange. You will find them at the northwest end of the Merchant Market.}
{212}{DECK_58}{He's the head of the Crimson Caravan.}
{213}{DECK_59}{They're the last of the merchants, and I mean that literally. Small time stuff, mostly. Look northeast of the Merchant Market.}
{214}{DECK_60}{Amusing. He considers himself the leader of the Far Go Traders. More of a figurehead, actually. He knows better than to interfere with my business.}
{215}{DECK_61}{She's in charge of the Weapons Store.}
{216}{DECK_62}{Something is making the Far Go Traders' caravans disappear. I'd like to know the cause, since it does disrupt a piece of my business.}
{217}{Deck_63}{It's in the center of town.}
{218}{DECK_64}{Myths and legends. The Deathclaw is supposedly a ghost or something.}
{219}{DECK_65}{Old Town takes up the entire east side. The skags live there.}
{220}{DECK_66}{Most merchants live there. Simply go west from here.}
{221}{DECK_67}{An annoying organization. Soon they may need a demonstration in the management of power.}
{222}{DECK_68}{Morpheus is the head of the Children of the Cathedral. He resides down in the Boneyard.}
{223}{DECK_69}{She's presently the head of the Children of the Cathedral in the Hub. I've reason to believe that may change soon.}
{224}{DECK_70}{One of the fabrications of the Children. He's supposedly some minor deity, or something.}
{225}{DECK_71}{It's a small place that sells... fair weapons. Over by the Far Go Traders.}
{226}{DECK_72}{Just out the door and to the north. You can't miss it.}
{227}{DECK_73}{That's not important.}
{228}{DECK_74}{What? That isn't important now.}
{229}{DECK_75}{Really. Now why would I want to do that?}
{230}{}{I see you have disposed of my Second. I will have to take care of you myself.}
{231}{}{How good to see you Sheriff Greene! I see you've come to say your goodbyes.}
