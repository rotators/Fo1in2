; movie.cfg
;
; This is an example movie config file.  Movie config files control
; hardware fading of movies.  This file is just an example and will
; do nothing to any movies in the game (unless you have a movie named
; movie.mve - so don't do that).
;
; Movie config files should be the same name as the movie they go with,
; but with a .cfg extension.  They should also be located in the same
; directory as the movie.

;
; The [info] section is required, and specifices how many times you
; are going to do a fade effect, and on which frames those effects
; are supposed to start.

[info]
total_effects=3                 ; Total number of fading effects.
effect_frames=0,30,60           ; The frame number each effect will start on.

;
; For each frame number listed in effect_frames, you need to have
; a corresponding section describing that effect.  The section name
; is the frame number the effect starts on.
;
; fade_type can be "in" or "out".  Fading in means that you are fading
; from the specified rgb value to the movie palette.  Fading out means
; you are fading from the movie palette to the specified rgb value.
