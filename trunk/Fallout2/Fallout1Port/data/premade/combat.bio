
PERSONAL BIO DATA:

"Stone" to his friends,
Maxwell is the largest
person currently living
in the Vault. He is
known for his physical
strength and stamina.
He would make the ideal
volunteer due to his
tremendous size and
strength. It is
unfortunate that his
intelligence was
affected after birth
when the labor bot
dropped him on his
head. He doesn't care
that he might have to
leave the Vault.
