{200}{}{Your metabolic rate is twice normal.  This means that you are much less resistant to radiation and poison, but your body heals faster.}
{201}{}{A little slower, but a little bigger.  You may not hit as often, but they will feel it when you do!  Your total action points are lowered, but your Strength is increased.}
{202}{}{You are not quite as big as the other villagers, but that never slowed you down.  You can't carry as much, but you are more agile.}
{203}{}{One of your hands is very dominant.  You excel with single-handed weapons, but two-handed weapons cause a problem.}
{204}{}{Your attacks show a lot of finesse.  You don't do as much damage, but you cause more critical hits.}
{205}{}{By not paying attention to any threats, you can act a lot faster in a turn.  This lowers your armor class to just what you are wearing, but you sequence much faster in a combat turn.}
{206}{}{You swing harder, not better.  Your attacks are very brutal, but lack finesse.  You rarely cause a good critical, but you always do more melee damage.}
{207}{}{You don't have time to aim for a targeted attack, because you attack faster than normal people.  It costs you one less action point for guns and thrown weapons.}
{208}{}{By some strange twist of fate, people around you die violently.  You always see the worst way a person can die.}
{209}{}{The good thing is that everyone around you has more critical failures in combat, the bad thing is so do you!}
{210}{}{You studied less-combative skills as you were growing up.  Your combat skills start at a lower level, but First Aid, Doctor, Speech and Barter are substantially improved.}
{211}{}{You are more easily influenced by chems.  Your chance to be reliant by chem use is twice normal, but you recover faster from their ill effects.}
{212}{}{Chems only affect you half as long as normal, but your chance to be reliant is also only 50% of normal.}
{213}{}{As a night-time person, you are more awake when the sun goes down.  Your Intelligence and Perception are improved at night, but dulled during the day.}
{214}{}{Since you spent more time improving your skills than a normal person, you gain 5 additional skill points per experience level. The tradeoff is that you do not gain as many extra abilities. You gain a perk every four levels.}
{215}{}{You have more innate abilities than most, so you have not spent as much time honing your skills.  Your primary statistics are each +1, but you lose -10% on all skills to start, and receive 5 less skill points per level.}
