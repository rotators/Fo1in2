# *** FEV Experiment Disk ***
{1000}{}{•  Log Date March 21, 2075:}
{1001}{}{Major Barnett has ordered experiments with batch}
{1002}{}{10-011 of  panimmunity virion, which has been }
{1003}{}{renamed FEV, for Forced Evolutionary Virus. His}
{1004}{}{main concern is with the side effects of the }
{1005}{}{quad-helix structure rather than its main effect}
{1006}{}{of replicative stability. He believes the new }
{1007}{}{structure is the next logical step for mammalian}
{1008}{}{nuclei. Experiments with single-celled organisms}
{1009}{}{is a great success. While their basal metabolism}
{1010}{}{appears unchanged, their immunity to infection }
{1011}{}{and radiation is exceeding all earlier expectations.}
{1012}{}{Addendum: chloroplasts seem unaffected by the virion.}
{1013}{}{Further experiments on plant cells have been }
{1014}{}{canceled by order of Major Barnett.}
{1015}{}{**END-PAR**}
# -
{1016}{}{•  Log Date May 9, 2075}
{1017}{}{We infected several species of flatworm with FEV. }
{1018}{}{Within hours the worms had increased in size by }
{1019}{}{28%, and 39 separate viral contagions were resisted}
{1020}{}{by the population. Each sample was allowed to }
{1021}{}{continue for several generations, and the new DNA }
{1022}{}{structure was successfully passed on to worm's }
{1023}{}{progeny, although only asexual reproduction was }
{1024}{}{noticed in the samples. Experiments with insects }
{1025}{}{have had less success. Major Barnett has postponed }
{1026}{}{these experiments until further notice.}

{1029}{}{Several lab strains of white mice have been infected}
{1030}{}{successfully with FEV. Again, an increase in size }
{1031}{}{was noted within hours, and after 9 days all mice }
{1032}{}{had stabilized at 31% larger than the control group. }
{1033}{}{Dissection revealed the most increase in size in }
{1034}{}{striated muscle tissue and certain internal organs, }
{1035}{}{such as the liver, heart, and kidneys. In a }
{1036}{}{surprising finding, the infected mice were found to}
{1037}{}{run mazes in less than half of the time of the }
{1038}{}{control group. More testing will be needed to }
{1039}{}{confirm this finding as significant.}

{1042}{}{We have infected 218 rabbits with FEV. Half of }
{1043}{}{the subjects were implanted with electrodes to }
{1044}{}{monitor EEG activity before and after the }
{1045}{}{infection. Increased electrical activity in the }
{1046}{}{brain was noted in 3.2 seconds (on average) after}
{1047}{}{injection. Again, the typical size increase was }
{1048}{}{noted. However, increased aggression and posturing}
{1049}{}{(especially among males) was noted as well. }
{1050}{}{Sacrifice and profusion yielded brain tissue that}
{1051}{}{showed increased dendritic connection, especially }
{1052}{}{in the limbic system and frontal cortex.}

{1055}{}{With batch 11-011, we have improved the mitotic }

{1057}{}{raccoons with the new strain. In addition to the}
{1058}{}{now expected size increase, behavioral tests }
{1059}{}{confirmed an increase in intelligence and manual }
{1060}{}{dexterity by 19 points on the Schuler-Kapp index. }
{1061}{}{Unfortunately, several subjects escaped confinement}
{1062}{}{and had to be hunted down and dispatched. Major }

{1069}{}{batch 11-101a, we infected 23 dogs of both pure and }
{1070}{}{mixed breed, and all experienced nearly immediate }
{1071}{}{growth. The larger size was accompanied with }
{1072}{}{increased aggressiveness, while no significant }
{1073}{}{intelligence increase was noted. We plan to attempt}
{1074}{}{crossover of 92 allele pairs with batch 11-011. All}

{1080}{}{levels are unprecedented. Attempts to induce cancers}
{1081}{}{in the subjects through radiological and chemical }
{1082}{}{agents were not successful. Increased aggressiveness}

{3000}{}{Capt. Maxson was right. This place is death.}

{3004}{}{**END-PAR**}
# -
{3005}{}{We made it to West Tek Research Facility after}
{3006}{}{20 days of hell. But that was the easy part. The}
{3007}{}{radiation levels began to shoot up as soon as we}
{3008}{}{could see the giant crater. We checked our supplies}
{3009}{}{and figured with our armor and our anti-rad supplies}
{3010}{}{we'd be fine for a least a day of exploring. We }
{3011}{}{felt it was a calculated risk, but the technology }
{3012}{}{we had the potential of recovering was worth it.}
{3013}{}{**END-PAR**}
# -
{3014}{}{We climbed down the crater to the first level and }
{3015}{}{everything seemed to be according to plan. The power}
{3016}{}{was off, so we didn't need to circumvent the }
{3017}{}{security. Or so we thought. There wasn't much of }
{3018}{}{value on this level, so we pushed on.}
{3019}{}{**END-PAR**}

# -
{3022}{}{When Jensen dropped to the third level, all hell }
{3023}{}{broke loose. The security sensors had been burned}
{3024}{}{out on the first two levels, but not on the third.}
{3025}{}{Jensen was cut to ribbons before he knew what had }
{3026}{}{happened. We'd never seen weapons cut through power}
{3027}{}{armor like that. Men started dropping right and }
{3028}{}{left, and the ones who were still alive lost it. I}
{3029}{}{tried to regroup, but only Soto and Camarillo made}
{3030}{}{it back up here to the first level with me.}
{3031}{}{**END-PAR**}
# -
{3032}{}{ The fact that I can smell Soto's burning flesh }
{3033}{}{where his arm was taken off means that my power }
{3034}{}{armor is no longer air tight, so I'm sucking up }
{3035}{}{a lot more rads than I had planned on. I'm leaking}
{3036}{}{hydraulics at an alarming rate. We need to get far}
{3037}{}{enough away from this place before my armor dies. }
{3038}{}{**END-PAR**}

{3039}{}{Camarillo seemed fine physically, but he wandered}

# -
{4002}{}{In the hopes of countering the current }
{4003}{}{bacteriological and viral agents employed by the}
{4004}{}{Chinese government, we have manufactured a virus }
{4005}{}{fragment consisting of ribonucleic acid (RNA) }
{4006}{}{encased in a protein-lipid sheath. This virion }
{4007}{}{contains a specially arranged sequence of irradiated}
{4008}{}{amino acids (IAA) that are capable of attaching to}
{4009}{}{non-specific binding sites on deoxyribonucleic }
{4010}{}{acid (DNA) and force a non-replicating mitosis to}
{4011}{}{occur. The resulting host cell is left with a }
{4012}{}{quadruple-helix DNA structure.}
{4013}{}{**END-PAR**}
# -
{4014}{}{Early tests are promising. The virion easily }
{4015}{}{penetrates the cell membrane and attaches directly}
{4016}{}{to the host DNA in the nucleus. Mitosis of the }
{4017}{}{structure begins almost immediately. Cytokinesis }
{4018}{}{is prevented by controlling the disposition of the}
{4019}{}{kinetochore fibers during anaphase. The entire }
{4020}{}{mitotic cycle lasts approximately 2 hours, although}
{4021}{}{phenotypical expression of the new structure may }
{4022}{}{take days or weeks to become apparent.}
{4023}{}{**END-PAR**}
# -
{4024}{}{In addition to an effective immunity to bacterial }
{4025}{}{and viral agents, the quad-helix structure is }
{4026}{}{almost entirely immune to errors introduced in }
{4027}{}{base pairing during replication due to multiplicity}
{4028}{}{of the base sequence. Radiation-exposed tissue }
{4029}{}{showed no mutation in the base sequence and protein}
{4030}{}{synthesis mechanisms in the ribosomes were unimpaired.}
{4031}{}{**END-PAR**}
# -
{4032}{}{Over 80% of the samples tissue contained quad-helix}
{4033}{}{DNA. Most affected was muscle and bone tissue, as }
{4034}{}{well as secretory cells, as these cells seem most }
{4035}{}{receptive to virion. Sensory cells are the least }
{4036}{}{affected. Surprisingly, even normally non-replicating}
{4037}{}{nerve cells and nonsomatic cell were induced to }
{4038}{}{begin mitosis. Further experiments will be necessary}

{6089}{}{mutations from the overdose of the virus. This would }
{6090}{}{account for the enhanced muscle and bone structure. }
{6091}{}{Additionally, the recessive genes which are commonly }
{6092}{}{found in humans have been manipulated in such a way as }

{14001}{}{**END-PAR**}
{14002}{}{2073. As China became increasingly aggressive with}
{14003}{}{their use of biological weapons, the United States}
{14004}{}{government felt that a countermeasure was needed. }
{14005}{}{The Pan-Immunity Virion Project (PVP) was officially}
{14006}{}{formed September 15, 2073. }
{14007}{}{**END-PAR**}
#
{14008}{}{2075. It became clear that the best way to combat the}
{14009}{}{newly created biological weapons was to alter }
{14010}{}{uninfected DNA so that it was no longer susceptible }
{14011}{}{to standard viral infection.}
{14012}{}{**END-PAR**}
#
{14013}{}{2076. Unforeseen side effects began surfacing in early}
{14014}{}{2076 with the PVP. Animal test subjects began showing}
{14015}{}{an abnormal growth rate accompanied by increased }
{14016}{}{brain activity. The U.S. government took notice of }
{14017}{}{these discoveries, and in the interests of national }
{14018}{}{security, moved a team on-site to secure and oversee }
{14019}{}{the project, which was now dubbed the FEV (Forced }
{14020}{}{Evolutionary Virus) project.}
{14021}{}{**END-PAR**}
#
{14022}{}{2077. FEV nears completion. Test on lab animals are at }
{14023}{}{a near 100% success rate. Size and muscle density }
{14024}{}{increase approximately 60%, and the potential }
{14025}{}{intelligence increase by 200%. Effects upon human }
{14026}{}{subjects remain unknown; although they are theoretically}
{14027}{}{promising. The military, wishing to continue further }
{14028}{}{testing, builds a large facility at the Mariposa }
{14029}{}{military installation in central California. At this }
{14030}{}{new facility, testing of the FEV virus continues on }
