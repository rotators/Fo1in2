{100}{}{The guard is enraged and begins to attack.}
{101}{}{The guard is frightened by your power.}
{102}{}{Only Shadow Sword can intimidate this guard by his very presence. You must do so through words.}
{103}{}{You successfully swipe something from the guard.}
{104}{}{You have been spotted.}
{105}{}{The guard has nothing else on him.}
{106}{}{The guard is unaffected.}
{107}{}{A Junktown gate guard.}
{108}{}{What are you doing in Junktown, stranger?}
{109}{}{Looking for a little fun.}
{110}{}{Give me everything you have!}
{111}{}{Might you assist me in acquiring equipment?}
{112}{}{Nothing. Thank you. Goodbye.}
{113}{}{There are a lot of things to do here. Let's see. You can practice your aim on the brahmin, or you can just wander around Junktown and see the sights, as long as you don't start any trouble.}
{114}{}{Is there anything else around here?}
{115}{}{Fine! Give me everything you have!}
{116}{}{Thank you. Goodbye.}
{117}{}{Well, supposedly one of the old residents had a nasty gun hidden in his house, on the northwest side. But nobody has every found it.}
{118}{}{Okay. Thank you for you time.}
{119}{}{Is there anything else?}
{120}{}{Okay, okay, okay. Please, don't hurt me.}
{121}{}{Not a chance! Die scum!!}
{122}{}{Well, supposedly the fellow who used to live in the building to the northwest had a pretty nasty gun. Maybe you can find it.}
{123}{}{Sorry, I'm just a guard. Try talking with some of the other residents.}
{124}{}{This is just a taste of things which you can do when the full game comes out. You can either: kill everything that gets in your way, pilfer and sneak your way through situations, or you can talk your way out of trouble and into the graces of others.}
{125}{}{When the full game comes out, you will be able to see more use of your skills than here.}
