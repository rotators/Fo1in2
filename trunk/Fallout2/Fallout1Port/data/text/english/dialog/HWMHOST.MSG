{100}{}{You see a Hub guard.}
{101}{}{Can I help you?}
{102}{}{Yes. Could you tell me where I am?}
{103}{}{Goodbye.}
{104}{}{Uhhhhhhh. Huh huh. Uhhhhh. Huh.}
{105}{}{Man, you're dumber than a bag of hammers, aren't you? Get outta' here}

{107}{}{Who are the Water Merchants?}
{108}{}{A hospital?}
{109}{}{Thank you. Bye.}
{110}{}{Those bastards. They think they own the damn Hub just because they have control of the Water Tower.}
{111}{}{A hospital?}
{112}{}{Thank you. Bye.}
{113}{}{The Children of the Cathedral run a small hospital here in the Hub. They seem like a decent bunch.}
