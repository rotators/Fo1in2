{100}{}{What do you want?}
{101}{}{Your guards said you had a job for me.}
{102}{}{I don't like your attitude, old man.}
{103}{}{Nothing.}
{104}{}{Fluup.}
{105}{}{I might... Have you ever dealt with a vicious murdering band of thieves before?}
{106}{}{Don't tell me. You've got a gang problem.}
{107}{}{What is it out here? Is there any place in the wasteland that doesn't have a gang problem?}
{108}{}{I've dealt with a few.}
{109}{}{Uh... You've dealt with gangs before?}
{110}{}{You could say that.}
{111}{}{What's your problem, old man? I just said that I had, didn't I?}
{112}{}{No I haven't, and I don't plan on starting now. Good day, sir.}
{113}{}{Good, then you know how ruthless and bloodthirsty they can be. The Blades are the worst of them all, I'm afraid. We're a humble, god-fearing town that is only trying to survive, and these... these... monsters... prey on us... [He whispers under his breath] and our children...}
{114}{}{Yeah, yeah, that's great. What's the job entail and what's it worth to ya?}
{115}{}{What do you mean 'prey on you?'}
{116}{}{Why don't you get your guards to do something about them?}
{117}{}{Well, the Regulators keep them from attacking us outright, but it's all they can do to keep our little community safe. They try to sneak in at night to kill our citizens, or to, to kidnap our children... and... [He stops a moment to compose himself before continuing] Just last week one of them burst through the north gate in the middle of the night with dynamite strapped to his body to blow up the Regulator's barracks... no doubt to weaken us enough so that they could launch a full scale attack.}
{118}{}{What happened to him?}
{119}{}{That sounds a bit extreme, doesn't it?}
{120}{}{Luckily, the Regulators killed him before he could complete his plan. I saw his body myself.}
{121}{}{I see. What would you like me to do about it?}
{122}{}{So you didn't actually see this guy run into your town with dynamite strapped to his body?}
{123}{}{I'll give you 2000 caps to kill their leader! I want that bitch's head!}
{124}{}{You seem to have something personal against her.}
{125}{}{Why just the leader?}
{126}{}{Sounds good to me.}
{127}{}{They'll fall apart without her... her... vile influence.}
{128}{}{Sounds like a fun girl.}
{129}{}{I've heard enough. I'll do it.}
{130}{}{Uh, right. I want no part of this sickness.}
{131}{}{She had my son kidnapped, tortured and killed. They left him impaled on a post right outside the gates.}
{132}{}{Those sick bastards... I'll take the job.}
{133}{}{I don't think I want the job, after all.}
{134}{}{Thank the gods. Finally, my son shall be avenged. The Blades camp is to the north of here. Come back when you've done the job.}
{135}{}{It was the middle of the night, as I told you. I was asleep. Luckily, the Regulators usually catch these barbarians before they even make it inside our town.}
{136}{}{Yeah, that's pretty lucky. Pretty convenient, too.}
{137}{}{I don't like how this all sounds. Count me out.}
{138}{}{Get out of here then! If you won't help Adytum, Adytum has no need for you!}
{139}{}{I have no time for idiots. Get out of here.}
{140}{}{I might just ignore that remark if you've come here to solve my problem for me.}
{141}{}{What problem is that?}
{142}{}{What, that you're old and stupid?}
{143}{}{Have you ever dealt with a vicious, murdering band of thieves before?}
{144}{}{Don't tell me. You've got a gang problem.}
{145}{}{What is it out here? Is there any place in the wasteland that doesn't have a gang problem?}
{146}{}{I've dealt with a few.}
{147}{}{Not another backwater town with a gang problem! This is ridiculous!}
{148}{}{What would be convenient would be to put an end to their foulness once and for all!}
{149}{}{Let me guess - you want them dead.}
{150}{}{How can I help?}
{151}{}{There's a lot more going on here than I want to know about. I'll be going, now.}
{152}{}{What?! You again? What do you want now?}
{153}{}{I've reconsidered. I'll take the job, old man.}
{154}{}{I don't like your attitude, old man.}
{155}{}{Nothing.}
{156}{}{[He looks at you warily] The Blades' camp is to the north of here. Come back when you've done the job, and I'll pay you 2000 caps.}
{157}{}{Why haven't you taken care of it yet?}
{158}{}{I changed my mind.}
{159}{}{I'm working on it.}
{160}{}{Hey, back off old man.}
{161}{}{Well, work faster. Don't bother me again until you've ended her miserable life!}
{162}{}{Have you done it?! Is she dead? Is she dead?}
{163}{}{You need some help, old man. Yeah, she's dead.}
{164}{}{Of course. I made her suffer as a personal favor to you.}
{165}{}{Yes.}
{166}{}{Thank the gods!!! Here's your money. You'll always be welcome in Adytum, my son.}
{167}{}{Finally she knows the taste of hell fire! Bless you, my son. [He wipes away a tear]. Here's an extra 500 caps for putting in the extra effort. You'll always be welcome here.}
{168}{}{Have you done it?!? Is she dead? Is she dead?}
{169}{}{Wipe the drool off your mouth and sit down, old man. There's something we need to talk about.}
{170}{}{I've got something you need to hear.}
{171}{}{I've had enough of your impudence! Is she dead or not?!}
{172}{}{Here, listen to this.}
{173}{}{[As he listens to the holodisk, he begins to shake and turn red. You think he might drop dead on the spot from sheer hate.] I'll kill all of you fucking bastards!}
{174}{}{You bastard! You've brought the devils in to our home!}
{175}{}{You see a middle-aged man in civilian clothing.}
{176}{}{You see: Jon Zimmerman, mayor of Adytum.}
{177}{}{Yeah, what do you want?}
{178}{}{I have something you should listen to about your son.}
{179}{}{Never mind.}
{180}{}{Blorb.}
{181}{}{Who are you?}
{182}{}{I'm Jon Zimmerman, mayor of Adytum. What's it to you?}
{183}{}{Hello.}
{184}{}{Good to see you.}
{185}{}{Thanks for all your help.}
{186}{}{My son can now rest in peace.}
{187}{}{My son is revenged.}
