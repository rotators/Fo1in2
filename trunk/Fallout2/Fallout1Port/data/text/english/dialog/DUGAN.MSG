{100}{}{You see: Dugan, the Nuka-Cola addict of the Blades.}
{101}{}{You see a very tall, thin man with glasses. He has a bottle of Nuka-Cola clutched in his hand.}
{102}{}{Yes?}
{103}{}{I'm just looking around, thanks.}
{104}{}{What do you do around here?}
{105}{}{What's with the Nuka-Cola?}
{106}{}{Whose in charge around here?}
{107}{}{Ah, never mind.}
{108}{}{Dah, Cola, good?}
{109}{}{Well, then stop wasting my time.}
{110}{}{I pontificate on life a lot, and help the Blades understand the true meaning of Nuka-Cola.}
{111}{}{What's so good about Nuka-Cola?}
{112}{}{Is that all? That doesn't seem to help anyone that much.}
{113}{}{How much of that stuff do you drink?}
{114}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{115}{}{Ah, okay. I'll be seeing you.}
{116}{}{It is the stuff of life... Well actually, if I don't drink it on an hourly basis, I get a splitting headache.}
{117}{}{So? (He raises his eyebrows at you.)}
{118}{}{About 5 litres a day.}
{119}{}{Razor's the woman you'll want to talk to.}
{120}{}{I am the dumbest person I've ever met - well, besides you. Get out of here!}
{121}{}{I need another Nuka-Cola!}
{122}{}{Where'd my hair go?!}
{123}{}{Carbonated Water, Caramel Color, Aspartame, Phosphoric Acid, Potassium Benzoate (to protect taste), Natural Flavors, Citric Acid, Caffeine...}
{124}{}{Too bad we ran out of Diet.}
{125}{}{Where'd those short women go?}
