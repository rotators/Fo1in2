{100}{}{You see: Billy.}
{101}{}{Hi there.}
{102}{}{Hi, what are you doing?}
{103}{}{Can I have a brahma?}
{104}{}{Hi. Uh, bye.}
{105}{}{Arg!}
{106}{}{Ta.}
{107}{}{Why would you want a brahma? Do you have a caravan? Well, it doesn't matter. I only take care of them. Dan is the one that owns them; he won't sell them though.}
{108}{}{Why?}
{109}{}{I was just kidding.}
{110}{}{Cuz of all the missing caravans. He doesn't have any to spare, the caravans use most of them. The others are sold for food. Well, I better stop talking; Dan will get mad if he sees me talking to a stranger.}
{111}{}{Oh, okay.}
{112}{}{Nothing... I mean, I'm taking care of the brahmin.}
{113}{}{What's the spear for? Are they dangerous?}
{114}{}{What's a brahmin?}
{115}{}{'What's a brahmin?' You must be joking. Brahmin are one of the major food sources and forms of transportation around here. They haul the caravans. Dan says this is a really important job, but it's the bone. And by the way, it's 'brahma' - brahmin is plural. Dork.}
{116}{}{Oh, I knew that!}
{117}{}{Dan's right. You are doing a great job.}
{118}{}{Yeah, it looks that way. Have fun.}
{119}{}{Hey, you're one of those skags aren't you?}
{120}{}{Really? You think so? Gee, thanks.}
{121}{}{You're not from around here, are you? I'll give you one tip: Don't get caught stealing!}
{122}{}{Sure, thanks.}
{123}{}{I wouldn't dream of stealing. Stealing is wrong.}
{124}{}{Yeah, I think I'm starting to agree with you. This job isn't so bad, really. It makes me feel good for some reason. Well, I've got to go before I get in trouble.}
{125}{}{Please don't hurt me or my brahmin.}
{126}{}{Don't hurt me!}
{127}{}{Stop it!}
{128}{}{Please leave me alone.}
{129}{}{You're scaring me.}
{130}{}{Hey, what are you trying to do? I don't have anything you'd want.}
{131}{}{Stop that!}
{132}{}{Dangerous? No, not really. They can give you a really nasty bite, but they're pretty cool. They fart and burp a lot. I don't know why.}
{133}{}{So what's the spear for?}
{134}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{135}{}{Oh, they can be awfully stubborn when I want them to do something. I just gently stick them to get them to move around... plus I don't want to get too close; they sometimes kick.}
{136}{}{Please don't talk to me. Dan is going to yell at me again. He really gets piss- I mean... mad, when I'm not paying attention to what I'm doing.}
{137}{}{He's just trying to help. Work hard and I'm sure he'll be nicer.}
{138}{}{Here kid, take 50 caps and get away from this jerk.}
{139}{}{Okay.}
{140}{}{Aaaaaarg!}
{141}{}{Rhu?}
{142}{}{Please don't, I'm already in enough trouble.}
{143}{}{I AM working hard!}
{144}{}{I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. He's just trying to help you.}
{145}{}{No you aren't, you lazy little skeev!}
{146}{}{Okay.}
{147}{}{Yeah, maybe you're right... actually, he seems pretty cool, but I wish he wouldn't yell at me so much.}
{148}{}{Yeah, right.}
{149}{}{Up yours, you old fart!}
{150}{}{Up yours, you old hag!}
{151}{}{WOW! I can live on this for the rest of my life! Thanks a lot, mister!}
{152}{}{WOW! I can live on this for the rest of my life! Thanks a lot, ma'am!}
{153}{}{WOW! Thanks... Well...? You're just trying to get me in trouble again!}
{154}{}{Please don't talk to me, Dan is really mad.}
{155}{}{Don't worry. I had a talk with him; he'll try to be nicer to you.}
{156}{}{And he should be! You're a terrible kid!}
{157}{}{Wac.}
{158}{}{Hi!}
{159}{}{Those girls over there sure are dumb.}
{160}{}{Hi again.}
{161}{}{Brahmin are cool.}
{162}{}{Dan's taking me to the Falcon if I do a good job.}
{163}{}{Dan's going to take me on a caravan some day!}
{164}{}{I'm going to be an adventurer when I grow up.}
{165}{}{Really? Oh, okay. I hope you didn't hurt him. He's really not so bad. He just yells a lot.}
{166}{}{Hello again.}
{167}{}{What is it you do again?}
{168}{}{Can I have a brahma?}
{169}{}{Just stopping by to see how things are going. Bye.}
{170}{}{Arg!}
{171}{}{Ta.}
{172}{}{I'd better get back to work.}
{173}{}{Those girls over there sure are dumb.}
{174}{}{Hi again.}
{175}{}{I'm going to be an adventurer when I grow up.}
{176}{}{Brahmin sure do shi... uh, poop a lot.}
{177}{}{I can't talk right now.}
{178}{}{I don't want to get in trouble.}
