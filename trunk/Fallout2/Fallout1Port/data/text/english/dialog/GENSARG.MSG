{100}{}{Stop!}
{101}{}{Die, human!}
{102}{}{To the death.}
{103}{}{You will pay for your sins!}
{104}{}{I will crush you!}
{105}{}{Unity forever!}
{106}{}{For the Master!}
{107}{}{You are not supposed to be armed in this area, little brother. Explain yourself.}
{108}{}{You are not supposed to be armed in this area, little sister. Explain yourself.}
{109}{}{Hngg.}
{110}{}{It's okay, I work here.}
{111}{}{It's okay, I have a pass.}
{112}{}{I am armed by permission of the Lieutenant.}
{113}{}{What manner of treason is this?!}
{114}{}{Then show me your pass.}
{115}{}{I, uh, left it in my other robe.}
{116}{}{It's right here, stapled to the front of my gun.}
{117}{}{Hurry on your task then, but be warned: I'm watching you.}
{118}{}{Yes, little brother. What is it that you need from me?}
{119}{}{Yes, little sister. What is it that you need from me?}
{120}{}{Hng!}
{121}{}{Hmm, where's this Master guy?}
{122}{}{Praise to the Unity, brother.}
{123}{}{I am not one to guide you on the path to Unity. Leave!}
{124}{}{You are obviously a heathen! Pay for your sins!}
{125}{}{Here is here. Why do you ask?}
{126}{}{Oh, uh, no reason.}
{127}{}{I am going to kick his ass from here to, uh, someplace really far away!}
{128}{}{What question? I said 'Hail to the Master, goodbye.'}
{129}{}{You insult me! Die!}
{130}{}{Praise to the Unity.}
{131}{}{You sound like you do not believe what you say. Could this be true? Or have you left the path of righteous?}
{132}{}{You mistake the tremor in my voice for fear when it is actually a cold of some sort.}
{133}{}{I think your kind is doomed, actually. Here, let me prove it with some help from my friends...}
{134}{}{When you become one of us, you will not fear such minor things. Begone.}
{135}{}{What do you want this time? I have little time for your talk.}
{136}{}{Labbo!}
{137}{}{I have little time for your life... Die!}
{138}{}{Nothing, sorry.}
{139}{}{Praise to the Unity, brother.}
{140}{}{You are obviously an intruder!}
{141}{}{Get out of my face.}
{142}{}{I don't have time for you. Stop bothering me.}
{200}{}{You see a Super Mutant Sergeant.}
{201}{}{Hey, this looks like a nuclear bomb. Why is it here?}
{202}{}{This is our Master's weapon of last resort. If we find an enemy we cannot defeat in battle, then we will destroy them with this. But I doubt this will ever happen. Even our Master does not want to unleash the dreaded power of the atom again!}
{203}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{204}{}{Is it functional?}
{205}{}{You're welcome. Now be quiet, I need to concentrate on guarding this device.}
{206}{}{Oh, yes, it is. We keep it in perfect working condition, ready to be detonated at a moment's notice. The Unity will not be defeated!}
{207}{}{Ah, thanks.}
{208}{}{Aren't you worried that someone could steal some robes and sneak in here to set it off?}
{209}{}{No. We are here to guard it from intruders. No one could access the device without us noticing. Besides, the nuclear arming key required to arm the device is not here.}
{210}{}{Oh, that makes sense. Thanks.}
{211}{}{Well, for my sense of safety, could you tell me where the key is located?}
{212}{}{Oh, sure, no problem. The Lieutenant keeps the key. He's at the Military Base, so he isn't even around here. That keeps the nuclear bomb from being set off under our beloved Master.}
{213}{}{Thanks for your time.}
{214}{}{(The large mutant peers at you for a moment, with bushy eyebrows raised.) I think you are asking too many questions.}
