{100}{}{You see: Zack.}
{101}{}{You see a Gun Runner.}
{102}{}{Hi, I'm Zack. You want to buy weapons? Let me see what you have to trade.}
{103}{}{No.}
{104}{}{Okay.}
{105}{}{Can you give me a discount?}
{106}{}{You want to buy weapons? Let me see what you have to trade.}
{107}{}{Sorry to bother you.}
{108}{}{Nice doing business with you.}
{109}{}{}
{110}{}{Okay. Come back if you need anything.}
{111}{}{You'd better make up your mind fast. Are you here to buy equipment, or did you just come here to get shot?}
{112}{}{You have a real attitude problem.}
{113}{}{Sorry, maybe I could use some equipment after all.}
{114}{}{What the hell are you doing here then?}
{115}{}{Nothing.}
{116}{}{Sure.}
{117}{}{Yeah, well until Gabriel says so, you've gotta pay full price like everybody else.}
{118}{}{I don't know about that.}
{119}{}{Show me what you have anyway.}
{120}{}{Great! Show me what you got.}
{121}{}{I'll stop by later for that discount.}
{122}{}{Can I get a better discount?}
{123}{}{Sorry. I've given you the best discount I can.}
