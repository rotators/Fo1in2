{100}{}{You see: Vree.}
{101}{Vree00}{I'm sorry, you're disrupting my meditation. Please leave.}
{102}{}{I'm sorry. I'll come back another time.}
{103}{}{I'll be back.}
{104}{}{How could I know your schedule?}
{105}{}{Uhhh?}
{106}{Vree01}{Don't raise your voice to me. Do I have to have one of the Brothers teach you some manners.}
{107}{}{Sorry.}
{108}{}{Yeah, okay. Whatever.}
{109}{}{Oh, I'm scared.}
{110}{Vree02}{Greetings. It's a fine day for learning. Can I help you?}
{111}{}{I know you're the Head Scribe, but what does that mean?}
{112}{}{I need some technical information.}
{113}{}{Uhh...}
{114}{Vree03}{I record the knowledge of our ancestors for future generations.}
{115}{}{Interesting. That means you know stuff.}
{116}{Vree03a}{Yes. I guess you could say I know, 'stuff.'}
{117}{Vree17}{What can I help you with?}
{118}{Vree17a}{Go ahead.}
{119}{}{I need a Water Chip repaired. Can you help me?}
{120}{}{I'd like to know more about the weapons we make here.}
{121}{}{I heard something about holodisks, how can I read them?}
{122}{}{How can I prevent radiation poisoning?}
{123}{}{What's causing all the mutations?}
{124}{Vree18}{Speak to the Knights. Ask them to show you one of the latest laser pistols I designed.}
{125}{}{Thanks!}
{126}{}{I've got another question...}
{127}{Vree19}{You are not yet capable of properly using the sacred knowledge.}
{128}{Vree21}{Use your Pip-Boy 2000 to read the disks. Insert the disk into the reader. If you have the proper computer skills, you should be able to scan the data.}
{129}{}{Where can I learn the computer skills?}
{130}{}{Thanks.}
{131}{}{Can I ask another question?}
{132}{Vree22}{The Brotherhood has some automated courses that you can take. Here, I'll show you.}
{133}{Vree23}{Use this terminal to learn the basics of computer operations.}
{134}{Vree24}{You're not very bright, are you? You're wearing a holodisk reader on your arm.}
{135}{Vree25}{You would need some anti-radiation drugs. I have some. Take these immediately if you think you are near radiation.}
{136}{}{Thanks!}
{137}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{138}{Vree26}{Don't drink the glowing water.}
{139}{Vree27}{Between the nuclear and biogenetic weapons used in the War, it's surprising we don't have more mutations. However, if we can hold out, everything will be okay.}
{140}{}{Why do you say that?}
{141}{}{You're right. We'll be fine.}
{142}{}{I've got another question...}
{143}{Vree28}{All the mutants I've studied have been sterile - they can't breed with another creature. If we could clean up the mutation sources, we should be able to simply outlive the mutants.}
{144}{}{Sounds like a plan.}
{145}{}{Interesting theory. Any proof?}
{146}{}{I've got another question...}
{147}{Vree29}{Here, take this holodisk, it's got copies of my autopsies on mutant corpses. It clearly shows that no mutant could possibly reproduce successfully.}
{148}{}{Thanks.}
{149}{}{Can I ask something else?}
{150}{Vree30}{I don't think I should tell you anything. Perhaps later, if you prove yourself to the Brotherhood's cause. }
{151}{Vree31}{I'm quite certain you're in the wrong place. Please leave, I'm rather busy.}
{152}{Vree32}{You will destroy the knowledge that can save the world!}
{153}{}{Yeah, starting with you.}
{154}{}{No. I'm stopping those who could bring about another nuclear war.}
{155}{Vree33}{Never! The Brotherhood will see that it never happens again!}
{156}{}{That's what they all say... except you. You'll be dead.}
{157}{Vree34}{What can I help you with?}
{158}{}{I've got some important news to tell you about Kedrick. He's a traitor.}
{159}{}{What you would do if there was corruption within the Brotherhood.}
{160}{}{Nuhh. Nuh-uh-nuh!}
{161}{Vree35}{Very good. I really can tell the lessons have helped.}
{162}{Vree36}{Kedrick? He's been a loyal member of the Brotherhood forever. I doubt you would even know what that means.}
{163}{}{Yeah, I do. Kedrick is a traitor and planning to overthrow your leaders.}
{164}{}{Maybe so.}
{165}{Vree37}{You're certain of this? Perhaps we should go talk to the High Elder.}
{166}{Vree38}{Do not bother me with innuendo. Bring proof to the High Elder, or say nothing of this.}
{167}{Vree39}{Do what must be done. Stamp out the heresy and remove those responsible for the stain.}
{168}{}{Even if it was a trusted member of the Brotherhood.}
{169}{}{And who would do the removal?}
{170}{Vree40}{Even so. But proof would have to be offered.}
{171}{}{Kedrick is a traitor. He is planning on killing the Elders.}
{172}{}{I'll get the proof.}
{173}{Vree41}{Then we must go to the High Elder. Bring your proof and we'll go talk to him.}
{174}{Vree42}{The High Elder and Rhombus, of course.}
{175}{Vree43}{Did you hear about the missing Initiate? This is terrible!}
{176}{}{I agree.}
{177}{}{Nuh-huh.}
{178}{Vree44}{If you can help him, I would be most grateful.}
{179}{Vree45}{Good deeds should be rewarded. For helping the Initiate, please take these.}
{180}{Vree46}{Oh, it's you. What do you want?}
{181}{}{I came to apologize.}
{182}{}{Sorry, wrong room.}
{183}{Vree47}{Thank you for your apology. }
{184}{Vree47a}{Good day.}
{185}{Vree48}{That sounds like a manufacturing problem. We handle theory and design only. Have one of the Knights help you out.}
{186}{}{Thanks anyway.}
{187}{}{Can I ask something else?}
{188}{Vree200}{Please talk to one of the other Scribes. I'm trying to finish up reports for the other Elders.}
{189}{Vree201}{I don't know anything about that. But it sounds like something I should research.}
{190}{Vree202}{Sorry, not one of my specialties. Maybe one of the other Brothers would know.}
{191}{Vree203}{Guards! Guards!}
{192}{Vree204}{You've destroyed my room!}
{193}{Vree205}{What do you think you're doing with my things?}
{194}{Vree300}{Who? Wait, that name sounds a familiar. Perhaps he is a leader of some of the mutants.}
{195}{Vree301}{I assume you're referring to the last nuclear war. The Brotherhood is doing everything it can to restore that which was lost.}
{196}{Vree302}{They are high-density, laser-readable, manufactured-crystal storage devices. Each one holds over 4000 gigabytes of information.}
{197}{Vree303}{The only salvation this tortured planet and its people have. Without us, humanity is sure to perish.}
{198}{Vree304}{I don't know. Ask Manufacturing about it.}
{199}{Vree305}{He makes sure the Brotherhood stays on the path of righteousness.}
{200}{Vree306}{He enforces the High Elder's wishes. With force, if necessary.}
{300}{}{Interesting.}
{301}{}{Okay, that should do it.}
{302}{}{This should correct that.}
{303}{}{Good.}
{304}{}{I knew that was going to work.}
{305}{}{What was the formula again?}
{306}{}{The algorithm is wrong, that can't be. Something must be wrong with the computer.}
{307}{}{Here we are.}
{308}{}{Okay, so if we do this... yes, I think it will work.}
{400}{}{You can use this terminal to increase your computer skills.}
{401}{}{The lesson finishes six hours later. You feel exhausted.}
