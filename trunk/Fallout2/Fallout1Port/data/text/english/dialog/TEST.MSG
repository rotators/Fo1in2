{100}{}{You see: Kyle.}
{101}{}{What's up man, how are you doing? Still travellin' afoot... Aren't you tired? Maybe it's a time to think about cool wheels for your journeys? Are you ready to spend some money?}
{102}{}{How am I? Never felt better! And do you really have such a set of wheels for me? Money's not a problem.}
{103}{}{If I cut you a little, may be you'll give it to me for no charge?}
{104}{}{That's a good question. Seems I should turn to you later.}
{105}{}{Hmmm... Well, I'm not sure. A wealthier buyer could be of more use. Listen, why don't you come back a little bit later, when you have some more caps?}
{106}{}{Believe me, a friend of mine has a REAL business. It seems, he is the only person in the wasteland who could sell you a car. The place is not so far away from here. It should take about one day to get there. Dude uses his own house as a parking garage... 400 caps would be enough for me to show you the way.}
{107}{}{Deal. Just get me to your friend and I'll take care of the rest.}
{108}{}{Sorry, Kyle. I have more important things to do.}
{109}{}{Okay, I'll take your there. Anything for a hunky costumer, anything! Follow me. [accepts 400 caps]}
{110}{}{I knew you'd chicken out. Everyone is afraid of travel having so much money. However my raider friends will help you with that! [You come to understand that something went wrong, but suddenly a strong kick in the head knocks you down unconscious. Last thing you feel is that you are being dragged somewhere...]}
{111}{}{Listen, scumbag. Get lost. Your threats are empty.}
{112}{}{I should look for a more convenient customer.}
