{100}{}{You see a flower child.}
{101}{}{Hello! Would you... oh, excuse me...}
{102}{}{You! I heard about you! You kill kids and eat them! Mother Jain! Mother Jain! Help!}
{103}{}{Would you like a flower, mister?}
{104}{}{Would you like a flower, madam?}
{105}{}{Empty}
{106}{}{Is there anything special about this place?}
{107}{}{What's so special about the flower?}
{108}{}{What are you charging, kid?}
{109}{}{Sure, kid!}
{110}{}{No thanks.}
{111}{}{Sure. I could get off on stomping it to pieces!}
{112}{}{[sniff, sniff]. Smell nice!}
{113}{}{[sniff, sniff]. Smell yuck!}
{114}{}{Silly! You already got a flower!}
{115}{}{Do you want the flower or don't you!}
{116}{}{I'll take the flower if you tell me a little about this place.}
{117}{}{What's so special about the flower?}
{118}{}{Sure, kid!}
{119}{}{Enough about the damn flower. Just answer the question!}
{120}{}{}
{121}{}{It's a Unity Rose. It's the color of the Holy Flame, and represents the peace and harmony we'll have when the Children of the Cathedral helps everyone in the whole world become friendly and strong! Uh, do you want one?}
{122}{}{}
{123}{}{Now how's a rose going to do all that?}
{124}{}{Tell me about the Holy Flame...}
{125}{}{How much is it, kid?}
{126}{}{Sure, kid!}
{127}{}{}
{128}{}{Look. I don't want your damn flower.}
{129}{}{It's free. We don't believe in money. The Holy Flame takes care of all of our needs! It's so wonderful! You should join us in our Cathedral of Happiness! Uh, do you want one?}
{130}{}{Tell me about the Cathedral...}
{131}{}{Tell me about the Holy Flame...}
{132}{}{Sure, kid!}
{133}{}{}
{134}{}{}
{135}{}{Thank you, oh thank you! I gave away a flower! Isn't that great?}
{136}{}{You're mean! I hate you! I hope you get eaten by the Holy Flame!}
{137}{}{They sure do! Have one! I gave away a flower! Isn't that great?}
{138}{}{You're stupid! I hope the Holy Flame kills you before you can say anymore stupid things. Mother Jain, watch out for the stupid man!}
{139}{}{We're the Children of the Cathedral. We've been commanded by the Holy Flame itself to feed the hungry and heal the sick. We're going to spread peace and unity everywhere, and everything will be soooo good! Here, have your flower!}
{140}{}{I don't think you want a flower at all. You're being mean to me!}
{141}{}{Roses won't do that, silly! Only people can change the world. And with the Holy Flame as our Master, we'll be sure to make everything nice and special! So would you like a flower?}
{142}{}{Tell me about the Cathedral...}
{143}{}{Tell me about the Holy Flame...}
{144}{}{Sure, kid!}
{145}{}{No thanks.}
{146}{}{I'll show you silly, you little...}
{147}{}{That's the fire that cleansed the world, and if we obey it, it'll never do it again! It wants us be smart and peaceful and unified and stuff! So would you like a flower?}
{148}{}{Tell me about this unity...}
{149}{}{Sure, kid!}
{150}{}{No thanks.}
{151}{}{Enough with the damn flower!}
{152}{}{It's a wonderful place near the ocean, where people spend all their time praising the Holy Flame and being good. And everyone there is kind, except maybe Father Lasher. Uh... would you like a flower?}
{153}{}{Tell me about Father Lasher...}
{154}{}{Sure, kid!}
{155}{}{No thanks.}
{156}{}{Enough with the damn flower!}
