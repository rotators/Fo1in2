# Necropolis motorcycle npc

{100}{}{You see: Griffith}
{101}{}{The ghoul is wearing an old, patched up motorcycle jacket. You see traces of tattoos on his rotten skin.}
	
# Float: (When using the bike without owning it and having talked to Griffith at least once.)
{150}{}{An original Chryslus Motors Cruiser ... !}

{200}{}{The ghoul just stares at you.}

# Dialog:
{1000}{}{Hey smoothskin, what'cha lookin at? I tell you what: You're looking at an original Chryslus Motors Cruiser, build... Uhm... Actually, I don't know when it was build, but it's pre-war and in top condition!}
{1001}{}{Back so soon, smoothskin? }
{1010}{}{Nice ride. Is the engine still running?}
{1020}{}{You know, I have seen plenty pictures of motorcycles in our vault library. }
{1030}{}{Please don't talk to me. Bye.}
	
{1100}{}{Of course it runs, dummie! Fill it up with energy cells and it'll come alive and roar like a beast!}
{1110}{}{Why are you telling me all of this?}
{1120}{}{I get it, you want to get rid of the bike.}
{1130}{}{Great, but there is a water chip I have to fetch. See you later.}
	
{1200}{}{I'm telling you all of this, because you look interested and capable and I feel we're in a bit of a situation here, which requires me to leave this hole as soon as possible.}
{1210}{}{Now come on. This place doesn't seem all *that* bad to me.}
	
{1300}{}{Are you serious? You see'n these green fuckers over there at the watershed? I say shit 's about to go down here. Soon. When that happens, I won't be around anymore.}
{1310}{}{So why you're not leaving with the bike? That seems like the obvious thing to do.}
	
{1400}{}{Because ... I'm out of energy cells. Even if I wanted to - which I do, believe me - I can't. Don't have any caps and sure as shit you won't find energy cells around here.}
{1410}{}{You need energy cells, huh? Would these do it for you?}
{1420}{}{What do you want for the bike?}
{1430}{}{That sucks, but I have to go now. See you later.}
	
{1500}{}{bla bla bla, I can't pay you.}
{1510}{}{Just take them and get the hell out of here before I change my mind.}
{1520}{}{You're right, that's not a good deal.}
	
{1600}{}{Wait, are you..? Really? ... Thanks man! Time to say goodbye to this death infested hole! Do you think there's something up north for the likes of us? Guess I will find out!}
{1610}{}{[Done]}
	
{1700}{}{You're from a vault, huh? I've been a vault dweller too once! Now look, it only brought the best out of me! Ha-ha! [He flails his scarred and boney arms in front of you] }
