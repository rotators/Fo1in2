{100}{}{You see: Knight Paul.}
{101}{}{Ahhh, so you're the new Initiate. Welcome aboard. What can I do for you?}
{102}{}{Who are you and what do you do here?}
{103}{}{Where can I get some weapons?}
{104}{}{Vree told me I could see a new weapon.}
{105}{}{Do you have a Water Chip?}
{106}{}{Do you have any Power Armor parts?}
{107}{}{Whaadda?}
{108}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{109}{}{I'm Paul, head of Energy Weapons Development.}
{110}{}{What kind of energy weapons?}
{111}{}{Do you have the laser pistol that Vree designed?}
{112}{}{Laser, plasma... you name it, I've built it... or at least re-built it.}
{113}{}{Any chance I can get one?}
{114}{}{That's great. Keep up the good work. Bye.}
{115}{}{You would have to see Michael to be issued a weapon. He can't authorize you for one though, for that you would have to see Talus.}
{116}{}{Alright, where can I find them?}
{117}{}{Okay, thanks for the info. Bye.}
{118}{}{They are both on the first floor of the base. Talus is usually in the training room and Michael does his duty just outside of the storage room.}
{119}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you some more questions?}
{120}{}{Thanks. I'll be going now.}
{121}{}{Sure. What can I help you with?}
{122}{}{Where can I get some new weapons?}
{123}{}{Do you have a Water Chip?}
{124}{}{Do you have any parts for Power Armor?}
{125}{}{Can I see the new laser pistol?}
{126}{}{Actually, I need to get going. Bye.}
{127}{}{Yes. The latest in hand held laser technology. [He takes a small pistol from a work table and hands it to you]}
{128}{}{This is nice, can I keep this? }
{129}{}{What kind of damage will this do to a person?}
{130}{}{That one won't do you much good. It's still lacking the lenses and amplifier. [He takes the pistol back from you and puts it on the work table] If you really want one, go talk to Talus or Michael.}
{131}{}{Thanks, where can I find them?}
{132}{}{Thanks, I should be going now.}
{133}{}{Can I ask you some more questions?}
{134}{}{A Water Chip? The ones from the old Vault-Tec shelters?}
{135}{}{Yes! Do you have one?}
{136}{}{No. Those things were junk, they were prone to failure. We don't deal with purifying our own water here. We have water delivered by caravans from the Hub.}
{137}{}{Okay. Thanks. Well I've got to keep looking for one. Bye.}
{138}{}{Could I ask you some more questions?}
{139}{}{In the hands of a skilled warrior, it could cut a person in half. The beam will shear flesh faster than you can run your finger through sand.}
{140}{}{Can I keep this one?}
{141}{}{No. I only work on energy weapons. You should go see Kyle if you have questions about Power Armor.}
{142}{}{Actually Kyle doesn't have the parts, that why I'm looking for them.}
{143}{}{Thanks. Bye.}
{144}{}{Well, I can't help you with that. Sorry.}
{145}{}{Thanks. I need to get going. Bye.}
{146}{}{Can I ask you some more questions?}
{147}{}{Hello again, Initiate }
{148}{}{. What can I help you with?}
{149}{}{Who are you and what do you do here?}
{150}{}{Where can I get some weapons?}
{151}{}{Vree told me I could see a new weapon.}
{152}{}{Do you have a Water Chip?}
{153}{}{Do you have any Power Armor parts?}
{154}{}{Whaadda?}
{155}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{156}{}{Um... please leave before you drool on something important.}
