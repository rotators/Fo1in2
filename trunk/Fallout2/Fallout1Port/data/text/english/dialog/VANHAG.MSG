{100}{}{You see a member of the Children of the Cathedral.}
{101}{}{I do not speak with heathen souls such as yourself.}
{102}{}{Your report, VanHagan.}
{103}{}{The Master is pleased with your progress, but his need is great and time is limited.}
{104}{}{The Master should know that raw material is limited. We cannot create our soldiers without more stock.}
{105}{}{He is aware of your problems. He is working on it, as we speak.}
{106}{}{Tell me of his plans. We will need to coordinate activities, if the Unity is to succeed.}
{107}{}{The Master has become aware of an undiscovered, and living, Vault. With that much raw material, we can create a great force. According to the prediction software, it will be the numbers we need to succeed.}
{108}{}{Excellent. This is most fortuitous. Are the inhabitants contaminated?}
{109}{}{Oh, this is the best part. If their representative is any example, they are clean. Pure-strain.}
{110}{}{Oh, this is most exciting. What Vault is it that we plunder?}
{111}{}{Vault 13. And we shall have them soon. Very soon.}
{112}{}{You earn 1000 experience for overhearing the whole conversation about your Vault.}
