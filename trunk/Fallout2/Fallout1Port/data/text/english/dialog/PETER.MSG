{100}{}{You see: Peter, leader of the Follower Scouts.}
{101}{}{What are you doing around here? Can't you see we are busy?}
{102}{}{Huh?}
{103}{}{I am sorry. I will go now.}
{104}{}{Can I help you with anything?}
{105}{}{Who can I talk to about giving my assistance.}
{106}{}{Great. I'm busy, and I get a moron tailing me. Go look for Jake if you need someone to talk to.}
{107}{}{Sure. You can start by getting out of my way.}
{108}{}{Certainly. Anything else?}
{109}{}{There must be something more I can do.}
{110}{}{Do not throw me to the side.}
{111}{}{Yes. You can get out of here.}
{112}{}{Fine. It doesn't look like I will get rid of you any other way. It seems that we are having a security problem. You want to help, you find the problem.}
{113}{}{Okay. Will do.}
{114}{}{Forget it!}
{115}{}{Fine. Get out then!}
{116}{}{Look, we have a breach in security. We need to find this breach and end it.}
{117}{}{Okay. Will do.}
{118}{}{Forget it!}
{119}{}{Do I look like a guide. Go talk to Jake if you are looking for a guide.}
{120}{}{Leave. I am trying to finish up a little work.}
{121}{}{We need that spy gone. Hurry up!}
{122}{}{Good job on taking out Heather. I should have known it was her. She always seemed to disappear in the raids. Here, take this and go.}
