{100}{}{You see a weary fisherman.}
{101}{}{Sir, I've heard about you, and I'd appreciate it if you left me and my boy in peace.}
{102}{}{Ma'am, I've heard about you, and I'd appreciate it if you left me and my boy in peace.}
{103}{}{Howdy sir. I don't often see strangers in this spot. Is there something I can do for you?}
{104}{}{Howdy ma'am. I don't often see strangers in this spot. Is there something I can do for you?}
{105}{}{You wouldn't happen to know where I could find a Water Chip, would you?}
{106}{}{You wouldn't know anything about mutant armies, would you?}
{107}{}{Where do you come from?}
{108}{}{How's the fishing?}
{109}{}{Give me everything you've got or I'll kill you!}
{110}{}{Runk!}
{111}{}{Wait a minute, aren't you that fella who wanders the wastes and kicks the monsters' butts? Can I help you?}
{112}{}{What a minute, aren't you that filly who wanders the wastes and kicks the monsters' butts? Can I help you?}
{113}{}{I'm running a little low on supplies...}
{114}{}{No man's ever called me inhospitable, and I don't want to repeat what women call me, but I am trying to fish and I need absolute quiet to catch the damn things. So please try to keep quiet.}
{115}{}{Has anyone ever told you that you ramble on?}
{116}{}{Okay.}
{117}{}{I'm looking for information.}
{118}{}{Do I look like a scavenger to you? Well, maybe I do, but that's because I spend a lot of time in the Wastes trying to teach my boy to fish and be a man.}
{119}{}{I haven't done any scavenging in six years. Too many radscorpions. A fella could get killed out there with all them varmints running around.}
{120}{}{About eight years ago, I sold some chips in Junktown. I don't know what they did. One of them could have been a Water Chip, though I wouldn't bet on it.}
{121}{}{Anyhow, I need quiet for my fishing, so I'd appreciate it if you'd keep quiet and let me get back to work before me and my boy starve.}
{122}{}{Mutant armies? Not in this spot. Just regular armies would be bad enough, heh heh.}
{123}{}{You know there's too much politics in the world. I keep telling my boy that these politicians can't wait to blow up the world again. That's why I'm living off the land, to avoid the politicians! Only way to live.}
{124}{}{Now that's rather personal information there. I've killed men for asking less, just ask the boy. But I think you look like an honest person, so I'll let it slide this time.}
{125}{}{Well, I've fished this place for the last five years and it keeps getting worse and worse. I think it's Skunk, the three-eyed giant catfish, that keeps scaring everything away from my spot.}
{126}{}{But I'm gonna get that fish, just you wait. It's getting personal between us, and only one of us is gonna walk away, believe me. I'm more serious than the Brotherhood of Steel about this.}
{127}{}{Now you'll probably kill me, but if I don't stand up to you, I'll be setting a bad example for the boy. See my dilemma? Why don't you just walk away and make it easier for both of us!}
{128}{}{I'm not walking away, and you won't be walking at all unless you do what I say.}
{129}{}{Shut up and die!}
{130}{}{Fine. I'll leave you in peace.}
{131}{}{Son, I think you've been wandering the wastes a little too long.}
{132}{}{Miss, I think you've been wandering the wastes a little too long.}
{133}{}{Try some of this.}
{134}{}{Try some of... oh damn, where did I put it...}
{135}{}{Well, I heard about a big Vault, way to the east, and reports of a secret Vault somewhere down south. And there may be some chips in Junktown and the Hub. Hope that helps.}
{136}{}{I hate to be inhospitable, but I need quiet for my fishing, so I'd appreciate it if you'd keep quiet and let me get back to work before me and my boy starve. And good luck killing those varmints.}
{137}{}{Mutant armies? Just plain armies would be bad enough. I heard tell that someone's been harassing the ghouls over in Necropolis, but that was a while ago.}
{138}{}{Now that's a personal question. My mother's womb, of course, but that's a little too flip. I don't have a home no more. Me and my boy just wander and try to survive.}
{139}{}{I do know where some caches are stored, but that's my secret.}
{140}{}{Well, it's kill or be killed - the Law of the Wastes out here - but I'll tell you what, you keep killing monsters and I'll give you some supplies.}
{141}{}{Yeah you are. But what the hell does 'runk' mean? Whatever it is, I hope it's friendly.}
{142}{}{Now I'm hurt. Here I go, out of my way to be neighborly, and you accuse me of rambling! Well! I don't offend easily, but you just gone and made me mad enough to nuke someone.}
{143}{}{Anyhow, why don't you just get outta here. Git!}
{144}{}{Thank you kindly.}
{145}{}{What do you want to talk about?}
{146}{}{I'm trying to find a Water Chip.}
{147}{}{I'm trying to find out about some mutant armies.}
{148}{}{What can you tell me about the Brotherhood?}
{149}{}{What can you tell me about L.A. Boneyard?}
{150}{}{I'm sorry friend, I don't think I can help you.}
{151}{}{'Runk' ain't the same as keeping quiet. Now shut yer yap and get outta here.}
{152}{}{Fine. Take what you want and get out.}
{153}{}{You really aren't very friendly, are you?}
{154}{}{You'll forgive me if I ain't more appreciative, but I think you should just leave.}
{155}{}{I try to avoid them if I can. Their patrols can be pretty nasty if they decide not to take a liking to you.}
{156}{}{That's down on the coast. I hear stories about gangs running amok and all sorts of things that I don't want the boy to see, so I'm staying away from that place!}
{157}{}{Now put that thing away before you hurt someone. A man can't have a civil conversation when there are weapons drawn.}
{158}{}{Son, there's nothing like a battle between a fish and a man.}
{159}{}{Son, did I ever tell you about the time I caught the giant eel...?}
{160}{}{Son, don't talk back to your father!}
{161}{}{Maybe this time I'll catch that three-eyed catfish.}
{162}{}{Dinner's coming right up!}
{163}{}{There's nothing like the taste of a juicy fish on an open fire.}
{164}{}{Quiet son, you're scaring away the fish.}
