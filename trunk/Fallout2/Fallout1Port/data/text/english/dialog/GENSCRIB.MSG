{100}{}{You see a Scribe.}
{101}{}{Vree's my idol.}
{102}{}{Vree is so pretty.}
{103}{}{Sophia sure is nice.}
{104}{}{Derek is cool.}
{105}{}{Will the universe continue to expand or will it eventually collapse back in on itself?}
{106}{}{I love those old books and magazines, but they are so hard to come by.}
{107}{}{Knowledge is power.}
{108}{}{The pen is mightier than the sword.}
{109}{}{Technology must be preserved.}
{110}{}{Science is so much fun.}
{111}{}{I've seen an alien space ship before.}
{112}{}{Did you know the sun is actually a big nuclear reaction?}
{113}{}{Did you know a black hole is actually an opening to another universe?}
{114}{}{Did you know that the hydrogen atom is 99.9843425% empty space?}
{115}{}{Time travel will one day be possible and we might be able to prevent the disaster that ruined our world in the past.}
{116}{}{Research is one of my favorite things to do. I feel like I'm trying to solve a mystery.}

{118}{}{These terminals could use enhancement. Maybe we should put the display over here?}
{119}{}{Sorry, I'm right in the middle of a possible breakthrough. I can't talk right now.}
{120}{}{Hey Initiate. You should train to be a Scribe, if you haven't decided yet.}
{121}{}{Us Scribes design all the equipment, weapons, and supplies. It's quite exciting.}
{122}{}{Please don't disturb me, I'm trying to finish my research.}
{123}{}{That's Vree right there, she's also a Scribe.}
