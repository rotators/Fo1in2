{100}{}{You! Stop right there and face the law!}
{101}{}{Thank you for returning the Water Chip. It's really going to help morale, and keep people from breaking Vault law.}
{102}{}{Good to see you again. Is there anything that I can do for you?}
{103}{}{What do you do?}
{104}{}{Yeah, I need some weapons.}
{105}{}{Why would there be a locked door in the Vault?}
{106}{}{Glop!}
{107}{}{Hmmm. I think you should be somewhere else besides here. Have a nice day.}
{108}{}{I'm in charge of Vault security and law enforcement. You might not know it, but the Vault wouldn't run as well if it wasn't for me.}
{109}{}{Hmm. Neat. Thanks.}
{110}{}{Sounds important.}
{111}{}{It is. Without proper adherence to the laws, the Vault would soon be a lawless place, with no direction. That would jeopardize the safety of us all.}
{112}{}{Now that I've been outside, are there any laws that apply specifically to me?}
{113}{}{I've seen some places on the outside world that suffer because they have no laws.}
{114}{}{Well, even if weapons are required on the outside world, don't display them in a threatening manner in here. Other than that, I can't think of anything in particular.}
{115}{}{Thanks.}
{116}{}{You see, I knew that would happen. People obeying law is the only thing that has saved the Vault from misery and destruction. Keep up the good work.}
{117}{}{The Overseer has not authorized me to open the armory and get you more weapons. I'm sorry, but I can't help you. }
{118}{}{Please! I really need them!}
{119}{}{Okay. Thanks anyway.}
{120}{}{No. I can't do it.}
{121}{}{Have a nice day.}
{122}{}{To keep the weapons away from those who don't have access to them.}
{123}{}{Who has access?}
{124}{}{That doesn't seem very fair.}
{125}{}{Life isn't fair, sometimes. But our law is. Have a nice day.}
{126}{}{The Overseer, myself and my security team. That's it.}
{127}{}{It sounds like only people with need have access.}
{128}{}{That's really a small list.}
{129}{}{Yes, it is. I have to get back to work.}
{130}{}{Yes, only people with need can get in.}
{131}{}{Well, I have need. Please open the door.}
{132}{}{I'm sorry, it's a good argument, but I can't let you in.}
{133}{}{Hmm. Now that you mention it, it sounds like you do. Here, let me get the door for you.}
{134}{}{What can I do for you, }
{135}{}{?}
{136}{}{I need more weapons.}
{137}{}{You feeling okay?}
{138}{}{Huh-huh.}
{139}{}{Great. Your intelligence staggers me. I can't possibly think anymore.}
{140}{}{Sorry, you've gotten all we can spare. Good day.}
{141}{}{I don't like your kind. Rabble-rousers. You should be ashamed.}
{142}{}{Yeah, well, same to you, muttonhead.}
{143}{}{Don't you think you're being a little harsh?}
{144}{}{Watch your language, or I'll bring you in for failure to respect a law enforcement officer.}
{145}{}{Yeah, right. See you around.}
{146}{}{That's it. I'm fed up with you rousting me.}
{147}{}{Hmm. Possibly. It should be my job to be impartial, but I might have stepped over the line this time. I'll try and do better in the future.}
{148}{}{Hmm. No. Probably not harsh enough.}
{149}{}{Good luck. I hope you can do the job.}
{150}{}{You'd better not let me down.}
{151}{}{Put your weapon away, right now.}
{152}{}{What do you think you are doing with that in here?}
{153}{}{Just practicing my aim.}
{154}{}{Nothing, sorry. Didn't mean to have it drawn.}
{155}{}{Hung.}
{156}{}{Be careful what you call me. And don't draw a weapon inside. This is the Vault for god's sake.}
{157}{}{You'd better not be practicing it in here. Me and you will have a serious problem if you do it again.}
{158}{}{I knew that outside life would get you into trouble.}
{159}{}{Halt! You're not permitted in there!}

{1000}{}{Overseer}
{1100}{}{He is the supreme authority of the Vault. The Vault answers to his decisions.}
