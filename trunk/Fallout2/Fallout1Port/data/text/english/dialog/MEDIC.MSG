{100}{}{I can't believe the things that you have done.}
{101}{}{I don't care. I'm hurt. Heal me.}
{102}{}{Hngh!}
{103}{}{No. I have taken a vow to not hurt life, but I will not help you.}
{104}{}{Lack of intelligence is no excuse for what you have done. Go away, I will not speak to you anymore.}
{105}{}{Oh my, you're seriously wounded. Here, let me help you.}
{106}{}{Welcome back, }
{107}{}{. How goes the search?}
{108}{}{It's going okay.}
{109}{}{I need help.}
{110}{}{Lol?}
{111}{}{Hmm... Ah. Yes. Here, I found these. Use them when you need a boost.}
{112}{}{Good, keep up the good work. And let me know if you need anything.}
{113}{}{What can I do for you?}
{114}{}{I need healing.}
{115}{}{I need some drugs.}
{116}{}{I need some more stimpaks.}
{117}{}{D'oh!}
{118}{}{Duh.}
{119}{}{I'm not authorized to give you any. Sorry.}
{120}{}{What a stick in the mud! Thanks for nothing.}
{121}{}{I have an urgent need for them. Without the drugs, the safety of the Vault is in jeopardy!}
{122}{}{Sorry, I can't give them to you.}
{123}{}{Well, since you put it that way. But don't tell anyone that I let you have these. They are extremely addictive and dangerous to use.}
{124}{}{Thanks!}

#orig: Stimpaks are being rationed. You are welcome to what we have in the medical container on the wall outside this room. Take as many as you need, but use them sparingly. It will be a while before we'll be able to get you some more.

{126}{}{Hmm. Let's see if you are hurt.}
{127}{}{You seem okay to me. Minor wounds will heal with time. Come back if you're in worse shape and we'll get you fixed up.}
{128}{}{You look hurt. Here, let me help you.}
{129}{}{If you need healing, come back here to me or use some of the stimpaks we have. You can get more stimpaks from the wall locker outside this room.}
{130}{}{Lie down here, and we will start the healing process.}
{131}{}{You are fully healed. Take care of yourself in the future, and do come back if you need any more healing. Have a good day!}
{132}{}{The medical scanners picked up some deadly radiation poisoning. Would you like us to attempt a healing? It will take a while.}

{136}{}{You see the Vault 13 medic.}
{137}{}{Okay, well let's have a look then. Hold still for a moment.}
{138}{}{No.}
{139}{}{Okay, do it.}
{140}{}{How long?}
{141}{}{How long will it take, and how much radiation can you remove?}
{142}{}{Na.}
{143}{}{Ya.}
{144}{}{Okay, fine, it's your body.}
{145}{}{It will take about }
{146}{}{ hours. RadAway would work a little faster, but we don't have any to spare. Shall we get started?}
{147}{}{No.}
{148}{}{Yes.}
{149}{}{It will take about }
{150}{}{ hours. I will be able to remove about }
{151}{}{ rads. RadAway would work a little faster, but we don't have any to spare. Shall we get started?}
{152}{}{No.}
{153}{}{Yes.}
{154}{}{This is going to be really, really painful.}
{155}{}{Don't worry, this shouldn't hurt at all.}
{156}{}{Okay, you should be feeling much better now. Be careful out there.}
{157}{}{I heard what you did, saving the Vault. Thank you.}
{158}{}{[More]}
{159}{}{The medic refuses to speak with you.}
{160}{}{Please don't do that.}
