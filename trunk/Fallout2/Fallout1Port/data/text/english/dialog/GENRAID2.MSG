{100}{}{The raider is too frightened of Garl to speak to you any more.}
{101}{}{You see a tough desert raider.}
{102}{}{It's the Death-Hand. He's returned!}
{103}{}{Excuse me, Death-Hand. I'm sorry to disturb you.}
{104}{}{Have you come back to kill your son?}
{105}{}{Aiyeee! A ghost!}
{106}{}{The dead walk again! The Death-Hand has returned!}
{107}{}{Well met.}
{108}{}{Hi.}
{109}{}{I'm waiting for Garl to crush Shady Sands. I want some loot.}
{110}{}{Welcome, friend.}
{111}{}{I'm glad that you could return for a visit.}
{112}{}{Unless you want trouble, you'd better put that away.}
{113}{}{Do you want to party? If not, put your weapon away.}
{114}{}{Oh, a tough one, huh?}
{115}{}{Garl Death-Hand loves his warriors. Put that thing away and go talk to him.}
{116}{}{So, you think you're tough, huh? Mess with me and we'll both find out.}
{117}{}{I don't like your look.}
{118}{}{Go away!}
{119}{}{What do you want?}
{120}{}{I'm looking for a woman named Tandi. Seen her?}
{121}{}{Nothing. Just looking around.}
{122}{}{Huh?}
{123}{}{Oh. You must be looking for a job. Go and see Garl in the big room and leave us alone.}
{124}{}{Then do it elsewhere.}
{125}{}{Nah, I ain't seen her. Why are you asking?}
{126}{}{Nothing. Just looking for a friend of mine.}
{127}{}{There is a bounty on her head. If I can kill her, I can get some good cash.}
{128}{}{You're lying. Where is she?}
{129}{}{Ah, okay.}
{130}{}{Really? What does she look like?}
{131}{}{About 6 feet tall. Blonde. She's from Shady Sands.}
{132}{}{Yeah, she's here. She's in the big house. You know, if we tell Garl, then he would want a piece of the bounty. You might want to think about that.}
{133}{}{You don't sound like you mean it. I think that you are up to something. And if you are telling the truth, then I'll bag the reward for myself.}
{134}{}{I... I can't say any more, or Garl will kill me.}
{135}{}{Bite me!}
{136}{}{I don't like your look. You'd better get away from me.}
{137}{}{What? Go away!}

{200}{}{He looks to be seasoned by combat and accustomed to the harsh life of the wastes.}
{201}{}{His body language says more than his expression. Both aren't very nice.}
{202}{}{He sneers at you and tightens the grip on his weapon.}
{203}{}{She looks to be seasoned by combat and accustomed to the harsh life of the wastes.}
{204}{}{You get the feeling that "lady" would not be an appropriate word for this woman.}
{205}{}{She makes a lewd gesture with her hips and winks at you.}
