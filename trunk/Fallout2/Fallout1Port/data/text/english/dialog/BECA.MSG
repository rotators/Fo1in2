# Alchemist: Warning! Achtung! Uwaga!
# Beca's script is bound to the ol' black male at the Blades map, but this is
# temporary measure. Actually Quatermistress IS a women! So she must be
# referenced as 'SHE/HER' NOT 'he/his/him'. 'Jade' stands for nickname and
# 'Bec'a stands for the real one.

{114}{}{Sorry about that. Goodbye.}
{115}{}{Can I crash here?}

{117}{}{Hey, bud! Wazzup? Crash here if you need a safe place.}
{118}{}{So, you've volunteered to help. Better than nothing, I reckon. Thanks. Gonna spread the word.}
{119}{}{Yeah, I'll go and see what I can do.}
{120}{}{Hey again. I heard you've actually helped us. You are more than worthy of our respect, indeed. We are free now. (You are now a member of the Blades gang.)}
{121}{}{Can't help you with that. Go talk to Razor.}
