{103}{}{You see: Jason, of the Follower's scouts.}

{110}{}{Who travels the halls of the Followers?}
{111}{}{Huh?}
{112}{}{I am }
{113}{}{. I come in peace.}
{114}{}{I am }
{115}{}{. Your destroyer.}
{116}{}{Who are the Followers?}
{117}{}{Okay. I can see that you are a little slow. Who you?}
{118}{}{Me }
{119}{}{. You dead.}
{120}{}{Me }
{121}{}{. Me hep.}
{122}{}{Me kill!}
{123}{}{Me }
{124}{}{. Me go.}
{125}{}{You want to help? I think you will need to talk to Nicole or Jake if you want to help us. They have more time to deal with slower people.}
{126}{}{Okay. Just stay out of trouble around here.}
{127}{}{Do you intend to end the evil of the Children?}
{128}{}{Yes. I want to wipe out those scum.}
{129}{}{No. I'd rather kill you wimps.}
{130}{}{Who are these Children?}
{131}{}{Why would I want to kill children?}
{132}{}{Excellent! Go talk to Nicole and she will be able to tell you how you can help us.}
{133}{}{The Children are an occult group who worship some dark god. Personally, I think there is something about them that reeks of evil.}
{134}{}{I will kill them.}
{135}{}{I don't know. They sound too strong for me.}
{136}{}{What can I do to help?}
{137}{}{Forget it! There is no way I will help you.}
{138}{}{They are a strong lot, but I think with someone of your skills, you will be able to get in and help us destroy them.}
{139}{}{I'll do it, then.}
{140}{}{No. I don't think I will help.}
{141}{}{Suit yourself. If they take over the wastelands, don't say we didn't warn you.}
{142}{}{If you talk to Nicole, she will be able to tell you more about what can be done to stop them.}
{143}{}{Thank you. Goodbye.}
{144}{}{Not children. We wouldn't think of harming them. No. These are the Children of the Cathedral. A nasty group of people.}
{145}{}{In that case, sure - I'll waste them.}
{146}{}{Oh. I thought you were talking about kids. Never mind. I don't think I'll help.}
{147}{}{What can you tell me about these Children?}
{148}{}{We are the Followers of the Apocalypse. We are trying to bring peace to the wastelands.}
{149}{}{Sounds like a good idea. Good luck with it.}
{150}{}{How do you plan on doing that?}
{151}{}{That seems highly unlikely.}
{152}{}{We are working to bring about tolerance to those in the wastelands, for those few unfortunates who have been mutated by man's destructive nature.}
{153}{}{Good luck with that, then.}
{154}{}{In all of history, we have never been able to become tolerant. Why do you think the War happened?}
{155}{}{That's just a bunch of bull.}
{156}{}{You are right in saying that we, as humans, have been close-minded. However, there is always hope.}
{157}{}{Good luck to you, then.}
{158}{}{I think you are right. Here, let me make you more open-minded with this.}
{159}{}{Be that as it may, your opinion was not requested. Goodbye.}
{160}{}{A cynic in our midst. I am sure you have your reasons. Regardless, I am certain we can bring about some type of understanding.}
{161}{}{Good luck to you then. Goodbye.}
{162}{}{I've heard that the Children have been able to get some of our secrets. I wonder how that is happening?}
{163}{}{I believe that there is a spy somewhere around here.}
{164}{}{I know. I am selling your secrets to them.}
{165}{}{I am sure you are just imagining things. How can they know anything?}
{166}{}{Truly? I thought as much myself, but feared that I would never have been able to get much support on the theory.}
{167}{}{Do you have any clues as to whom it could be?}
{168}{}{I'm glad to know that. Thanks for your time.}
{169}{}{You are the double agent!!!}
{170}{}{Not really. The only thing I can think of is that the person would have to have access to some information and have access to the outside. You might want to look to the initiates or scouts.}
{171}{}{Thanks. Goodbye.}
{172}{}{Nicole will be pleased then, to know that I killed the agent.}
{173}{}{You must be right. Thank you for setting me straight.}
{174}{}{I think you are the double agent. Trying to trick me, I see. Well now you DIE!}
{175}{}{Great job on wasting that agent. Now we might have a chance against those Children.}
{176}{}{Good luck to you.}
{177}{}{I can help train you to become a more efficient fighter.}
{178}{}{Would you? That would be wonderful.}
{179}{}{There you go. Maybe that will help you, if you get into a fight.}
