{100}{}{You see: Killian.}
{101}{}{Who are you?}
{102}{}{How about telling me a bit about this town?}
{103}{}{Do you own this store?}
{104}{}{I want to buy something.}
{105}{}{What's there to do around here?}
{106}{}{What do I have to do to help you get rid of Gizmo?}
{107}{}{I'd better go.}
{108}{}{Nu-uhh?}
{109}{Kill0a}{You want to buy something, friend?}
{110}{}{Uh-huh.}
{111}{}{Nuh-uh.}
{112}{Kill1m}{Welcome to Junktown, stranger. What can I help you with?}
{113}{Kill1f}{Hello, darlin'. What can I get ya?}
{114}{Kill1b}{What do you want?}
{115}{Kill1g}{Can I help you?}
{116}{}{How about telling me a bit about this town?}
{117}{}{Do you own this store?}
{118}{}{I want to buy something.}
{119}{}{What's there to do around here?}
{120}{}{What do I have to do to help you get rid of Gizmo?}
{121}{}{I'd better go.}
{122}{}{Nu-uhh?}
{123}{Kill02}{The name's Killian. Killian Darkwater. I'm the mayor of this fine town. And who might you be?}
{124}{}{I'm }
{125}{}{.}
{126}{}{My name is }
{127}{}{. I come from up north.}
{128}{}{What's it to you?}
{129}{Kill03}{Not much up that way 'cept desert and Shady Sands. You from there?}
{130}{}{No. I come from a Vault, to the west.}
{131}{}{No. My... um... village is a little west, in the mountains.}
{132}{}{Not really. Is there anything else up there?}
{133}{}{Of course, I come from there, you idiot.}
{134}{Kill03a}{Hey, you sound like you're hopin' I'll fill in some gaps for you.}
{135}{Kill04}{Yeah, if you say so. So what do you need?}
{136}{Kill05}{Oh yeah, sure you do. And when you were a baby, your crib was a safe.}
{137}{}{No, no. It's called a Vault. It protected us from the war. It's been full of people for 80 years!}
{138}{}{Heh, you got my joke. I actually come from a village not far from Shady Sands.}
{139}{Kill06}{Don't feel bad, ain't the worst story I've been told. So... what can I do for ya?}
{140}{Kill08}{Well, travelers tell me there's a bunch of crazies up north called the Vipers. Another group of yahoos out east called the Khans. Neither one of them likely to invite you to supper as anything but the main course, if you know what I mean.}
{141}{}{What else is outside Junktown?}
{142}{}{Thanks.}
{143}{Kill09}{Well, ya got the Hub southwest. Don't go south, though. That'd be Necropolis; the, uh... climate's bad there, rain or shine. If you understand what I'm saying.}
{144}{}{Well, thanks for the information. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{145}{}{You just know everything, don't you?}
{146}{}{I'd better be going now.}
{147}{Kill10a}{Hell, why not. Ask away, friend.}
{148}{Kill10b}{Yeah, okay. But make it quick, I got work to do.}
{149}{Kill11}{Well, Junktown's not much, but it's home. Mostly we trade with people or let 'em forget their troubles for a bit. Of course, we have our share of problems.}
{150}{}{Problems?}
{151}{}{What's there to do in this town?}
{152}{}{What other cities are around here?}
{153}{}{Thanks.}
{154}{Kill12}{From outside, we've had the occasional to-do with the Khans. But they've been pretty quiet lately. Inside, trouble's been from the Skulz. And I hear of some strange things happening down by the Hub, but they haven't affected us yet, knock on my mother-in-law's head.}
{155}{Kill13b}{Oh, we got tons to do. The Skum Pitt's on the east side, by the entrance. Great drinkin' place. Gizmo's is near there. And if you're hurtin', Doc Morbid's your man.}
{156}{}{Thanks.}
{157}{}{That's all there is to do around here?}
{158}{Kill14}{Well, if we're too fast for ya, just pass on by, pal. It is pal, ain't it?}
{159}{}{Better than nothing, I guess.}
{160}{}{Then there won't be anything exciting in town.}
{161}{Kill15}{By a damn sight.}
{162}{Kill16}{Oh, you obviously have me confused with someone who has to take your lip. Why don't you come back when your mama teaches you some manners.}
{163}{Kill21}{Well that's a damn fine coincidence! That's what this store's here for! We got about everything you can need. Let me show you some things over here... }
{164}{Kill22}{You bet. May not be as big as some in the Hub, but people usually find what they're looking for. Take a look around... }
{165}{Kill23}{You have to wear a recorder and tape Gizmo confessing, or plant this wire tap in his office. Either way, and we got him.}
{166}{Kill24}{Well, howdy! What can I do for you today?}
{167}{Kill26}{You again. What do you want now?}
{168}{Kill27}{Unless you're gonna pay for that, you'd better put it down.}
{169}{Kill28}{You're not too bright, are ya. Boys... }
{170}{Kill29}{It's obvious your mama didn't teach you manners. Am I gonna have to?}
{171}{Kill30}{Well, congratulations. You just earned yourself a night in a cell. Boys... }
{172}{Kill31}{Now what the Uncle Sam-hell do you think you're doing here?}
{173}{}{Uh... I got lost?}
{174}{}{Oh, this is your place?}
{175}{}{Well... I broke in.}
{176}{Kill32}{You're damn straight this is my place! Now get the hell out before I make your head a wall decoration!}
{177}{}{Okay, okay, I'm going.}
{178}{}{You? Wake up, pal, you're still dreaming.}
{179}{Kill34}{Uh, no. You got stupid. Get out of here!}
{180}{}{Okay. Sorry about the inconvenience.}
{181}{}{Who's going to make me? You? Don't make me laugh... }
{182}{Kill35}{An honest thief. Hmpf. Well, I'm still gonna have to take you in. Come along quietly and you won't get hurt.}
{183}{}{All right, I'll come along quietly.}
{184}{}{Right... I don't think so.}
{185}{Kill36}{Like I said... }
{186}{Kill37}{I already told you... }
{187}{Kill38}{I already told you... }
{188}{Kill39}{Are you hearing okay? I said... }
{189}{Kill40}{Look, if you don't remember, that's tough.}
{190}{Kill41}{Listen, I've already told you that numerous times.}
{191}{Kill42}{You leaving so soon? Better pay first.}
{192}{Kill43}{This is not something I take as a joke. Now. Pay up.}
{193}{Kill44}{All right. Fine. Let's see if a night in the locker will cool you off a bit.}
{194}{Kill45}{Any more questions?}
{195}{}{You bet.}
{196}{}{Nope. That's it, thanks.}
{197}{Kill46}{See ya 'round town then. Be careful not to get into too much trouble.}
{198}{Kill47}{Listen. Thanks for saving my life. It's a mighty brave thing to do. Looks like we got ourselves a situation here. I know Gizmo's behind this, but I need proof. You interested in helpin'?}
{199}{}{Me? What do you need me for?}
{200}{}{Can't you get someone else? I'm kinda busy... }
{201}{}{I'm in.}
{202}{Kill48}{Now, if I get proof, the people of Junktown will kick him out. Way I figure it, you need to either plant a bug at his place or wear a wire and get him to confess to you. Can you handle that?}
{203}{}{Whoa. Sounds kinda dangerous... }
{204}{}{What do I get in return?}
{205}{}{Ummm... no. Getting involved in other people's problems never works out.}
{206}{Kill49}{I'm not gonna lie to you, it will be dangerous. But I'll owe you one, and Killian Darkwater always pays his debts.}
{207}{}{You sure you can't find someone else?}
{208}{}{What do you mean, "pays his debts"?}
{209}{}{I don't think so. Sounds too dangerous to me.}
{210}{Kill50}{It'll work best if it's you. Gizmo doesn't know you, so he might trust you. Or, at least he'll have a hard time blaming me. Either way, you're the best person for the job.}
{211}{}{Fair enough, I'll do it.}
{212}{}{Pass. Getting killed doesn't seem like a fun thing for me.}
{213}{}{What do I get out of this?}
{214}{Kill51}{I'll tell you what. Anything in the store, even the most expensive, it's yours. No charge. If it's a gun, I'll give you all the ammo you can carry. Does that sound fair?}
{215}{}{Yeah. I'll do it.}
{216}{}{Not even close. I'm not risking my neck for that.}
{217}{Kill52}{Well, damn. That's too bad. But, you know, I'm gonna have to lock you up until this thing's done. Can't risk Gizmo finding out. Sorry.}
{218}{Kill53}{All right, I owe you. Here's the bug and the wiretap. You let me know when it's done. And good luck.}
{219}{Kill54}{So, did you get the evidence?}
{220}{}{Not yet. But I will, believe me!}
{221}{}{I sure did.}
{222}{Kill55}{Well, he's not going to come here and confess! You shouldn't even be seen with me until this is done. Now go.}
{223}{Kill56}{Which, bug or tape?}
{224}{}{The bug.}
{225}{}{The confession.}
{226}{Kill57}{Great! Let me make sure it's working.}
{227}{Kill57a}{Loud and clear. We're going to get him. In the mean time, we've got some business... }
{228}{Kill58}{Let's hear it.}
{229}{Kill58b}{That's the first time I've been happy to hear his voice. Thanks, friend. Now, time for you and me to take care of the other business.}
{230}{Kill59}{Well, thanks again. Oh, listen, I'm gonna take the guards and run Gizmo and his cronies out of town. I could use another gun. You up for it? Might be good for a laugh.}
{231}{}{Sure. It'll be worth it just to see him try to walk more than ten feet.}
{232}{}{Kinda depends on what you're willing to give me.}
{233}{}{Again? I don't think so. I've got way too much stuff going on.}
{234}{Kill60}{Go to Lars at the guard station. He'll fill you in. And listen, this town owes you... a lot.}
{235}{Kill61b}{Well, I can pay you the standard rate for mercenary work, 500 caps.}
{236}{}{Done.}
{237}{}{Sorry, not enough.}
{238}{Kill62}{Good enough. Go see Lars, he'll give you the details.}
{239}{Kill63}{Listen, that's all I'm offering. Thanks for getting the evidence, but I'm not going to beg for your services.}
{240}{}{All right, I'll do it for that fee.}
{241}{}{Oh, well. See ya around.}
{242}{Kill64}{Good luck in your travels. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a fat ass to move.}
{243}{Kill65}{Gizmo owns the casino. Named it after himself. Be very careful around him.}
{244}{Kill66}{Well, that's me. Where have you been?}
{245}{Kill67}{Oh, Lars heads up the guards here. He's a good guy. Pretty trustworthy.}
{246}{Kill68}{Well Vinnie, he's one of the problem children. He leads a group of punks called the Skulz. Still, they pay rent, and they haven't bothered anyone too much.}
{247}{Kill69}{Well, Doc owns a little place in the middle of the town. Does a nice patch job if you need it. Fairly reasonable prices.}
{248}{Kill70}{The Skulz are a bunch of punks who work for Gizmo. They don't cause that much trouble, but me and Lars keep an eye on them.}
{249}{Kill71}{Well, the Khans are a bunch of bullies who live outside to the east. They've been trying to take over Junktown for as long as I can remember, but they never make it past the gates.}
{250}{Kill72}{The Vipers are a crazy bunch from up north. They worship snakes, or something.}
{251}{Kill73}{That's my store. You need it, I got it.}
{252}{Kill74}{Great place to get a cheap room. Not too dirty, either. But don't mess with the owner, Marcelles, she'll pull your arms out if you smart off to her.}
{253}{Kill75}{Ah, Gizmo's is the casino by the entrance. I'm surprised you didn't notice it on your way in. You can usually smell the place for miles. But hey, it brings in the tourists.}
{254}{Kill76}{That's our resident bar. The food's okay, but the beer's great. The owner, Neil, takes no lip, not even from some of the raiders that come in.}
{255}{Kill76a}{Not much to say. Doc Morbid's pretty pissed 'cause their prices are lower for medical stuff. They're on the west side.}
{256}{Kill77}{The Deathclaw? Oh, that's a bedtime story. Drinks blood and howls at the full moon. Yeah, right.}
{257}{Kill78}{Well, the Hub's the main place for trade. Anything you don't find here you'll probably find in the Hub. Not sure how safe it is nowadays, with all those strange things going on.}
{258}{Kill79}{Shady Sands? That's a little place up to the north. I'd like to do more trading with them.}
{259}{Kill80}{That city's death. I sent two patrols down there and neither one of them returned.}
{260}{Kill81}{Well, there are two kinds, the Khans and the Vipers. We usually don't get trouble from the Vipers, and a few of them actually pass through town. The Khans, though, they're a mean bunch. They think they can conquer the world, or some such crap.}
{261}{Kill82}{Where've you been for the last 100 years? In a closet? My father used to tell me stories about the War. His father was a soldier before starting Junktown.}
{262}{Kill83}{Well, there're some rumors coming up from the Hub. Caravans disappearing, people being butchered, even some talk of big green monsters who eat human flesh. All sorts of weird stuff.}
{263}{Kill84}{Nope, I've never heard of anything like that.}
{264}{Kill85}{No clue.}
{265}{Kill86}{Ohhh... I really couldn't tell ya.}
{266}{Kill87}{Go talk to Lars. He'll tell you more.}
{267}{}{[Done]}
{268}{}{[More]}
{269}{}{You earn 600 experience for your part in the murder of Killian. Junktown will never be the same.}
{270}{}{You earn 500 experience for securing Gizmo's confession.}
{271}{}{I'm here to take you in, Gizmo. This time, I've got the proof I need.}
{272}{}{What do you know about this Gizmo character?}
{273}{}{Okay.}
{274}{}{Yeah, he's dangerous. I'm here to kill you for him.}
{275}{}{I'll say... that fat slob just tried to hire me to kill you. Why don't you do something about him?}
{276}{}{I'll take a shotgun and shells.}
{277}{}{I'll take a suit of leather armor.}
{278}{}{I'll take a doctor's medical kit.}
{279}{}{I'll take all the stimpaks you can spare.}
{280}{}{No thanks. Knowing that Gizmo's going to get his due is thanks enough.}
{281}{}{I'd like to take a look at traveling gear.}
{282}{}{I'll look around on my own, thanks.}
{283}{}{Never mind. Thanks.}
{284}{}{You moved against Gizmo without evidence. Y'know, he wasn't on the up-and-up, but neither are you. Go see Lars.}
