# These are generic selections for exiting dialog.
#  Instead of having an actual dialog option in the script, some scripts use these general goodbyes.
#  One is picked randomly each time the code is called.
#
# The way these were phrased means that they sometimes made no sense when used,
#  So I've changed them all to just "Goodbye". --Sduibek

{100}{}{Goodbye.}
{101}{}{Goodbye.}

# Translation note: 109 is referring to weapons,
#   if you try to give a hired NPC a weapon they aren't allowed to equip.
