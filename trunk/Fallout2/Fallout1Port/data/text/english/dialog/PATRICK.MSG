{100}{}{You see a man in studded leather armor with an odd assortment of knick-knacks.}
{101}{}{You see: Patrick, the Celt.}
{102}{}{Greetings, traveler. What brings you out this far?}
{103}{}{Just wandering.}
{104}{}{Um, why are you carrying all that junk?}
{105}{}{I need to find a water purification control chip.}
{106}{}{I'm killing everybody I can get within shooting distance of. Prepare to die.}
{107}{}{Lub!}
{108}{}{I see. Much like myself, then.}
{109}{}{Oh? You're not from one of the communities out here?}
{110}{}{Can you direct me to a nearby settlement?}
{111}{}{So what's your story?}
{112}{}{Well, see ya.}
{113}{}{It's not junk! It's trade goods!}
{114}{}{Uh, right. Bye.}
{115}{}{Uh huh. So what's your story?}
{116}{}{Hmm. Haven't seen one of those before. What seems to be the trouble?}
{117}{}{This chip controls water purification for my Vault. It's blown out, though.}
{118}{}{It's broken.}
{119}{}{I wander from place to place, making a living with music and a little bit of tinkering work.}
{120}{}{What kind of work do you do?}
{121}{}{What kind of music do you sing?}
{122}{}{Well, it's good to meet you. Bye.}
{123}{}{Using the coastline as a referent, you've got Shady Sands about a week inland, and Junktown a few days south of there. Hub's just another couple days south of Junktown. Avoid Necropolis to the east of those, though. Not worth the trouble.}
{124}{}{What do you know about Shady Sands?}
{125}{}{What do you know about Junktown?}
{126}{}{What do you know about the Hub?}
{127}{}{What do you know about Necropolis?}
{128}{}{I don't think I could help you with that. I never had much of a chance to study pre-War Vault technology.}
{129}{}{Mostly a little electrical and mechanical tinkering. I helped Junktown with their lights and showed the people in Shady Sands a better design for their stoves.}
{130}{}{Really? Think you could fix a Water Chip?}
{131}{}{Oh, mostly old folk songs and some Celtic music. It's a change of pace.}
{132}{}{Would you happen to know 'Na Gheala Mbeadh', as I think it's called?}
{133}{}{I see. What else do you do?}
{134}{}{Shady Sands is a small, self-sufficient community led by Aradesh, a kind man and strong leader. They are peaceful and hard-working. They are probably the best chance for a new civilization here.}
{135}{}{Shady Sands is a small farming community. They were led by a good man named Aradesh, but I've heard he's gone. It's a pity. Without him I don't know if they'll survive.}
{136}{}{Junktown? A small trading city. Strange place until you get used to it. They are run by mayor Killian Darkwater, a hard but fair man.}
{137}{}{Junktown? A small trading city. Strange place until you get used to it. They are run by Gizmo, a gambling mogul and crime-lord.}
{138}{}{Junktown? A small trading city. Not too remarkable.}
{139}{}{The Hub is a major trading center. It's said that you can find anything there, and I'd say that's not too far wrong.}
{140}{}{Necropolis is the city of the dead. It's inhabited by ghouls, the descendants of humans who sought shelter in a Vault there. Story goes that the Vault failed somehow, so now the only inhabitants are carrion-eating monsters.}
{141}{}{It was overrun by an army of mutants last I heard. I'd stay away from there, if I were you.}
{142}{}{Do you suppose that Vault might have parts that I could salvage?}
{143}{}{Possibly, but I for one wouldn't risk the ghouls. Latest word is they've some sort of powerful new leader.}
{144}{}{Why, certainly. Would you like to hear it?}
{145}{}{Sure.}
{146}{}{Nah.}
{147}{}{[Patrick sings songs and the two of you reminisce for several hours. You feel invigorated.]}
{148}{}{Hello again. Can I help you?}
{149}{}{Yeah, can you give me some directions?}
{150}{}{No, never mind, thanks.}
