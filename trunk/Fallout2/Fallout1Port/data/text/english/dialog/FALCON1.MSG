{101}{}{Yeah, whadda ya' want?}
{102}{}{Water.}
{103}{}{Beer.}
{104}{}{Liquor.}
{105}{}{Whatever will get me smashed the quickest.}
{106}{}{Nothing.}
{107}{}{Tuh?}
{108}{}{If ya' don't have the caps, get the hell out!}
{109}{}{Suit yerself.}
{110}{}{I think you've had enough, buddy.}
{111}{}{I think you've had enough, lady.}
{112}{}{Yeah... well beat it.}
{113}{}{That'll be two caps.}
{114}{}{Okay.}
{115}{}{No, thanks.}
{116}{}{That'll be five caps.}
{117}{}{Sure.}
{118}{}{That'll be ten caps.}
{119}{}{Hmmm, for one of your size...}

{130}{}{ one hundred}
{131}{}{ caps ought to do it.}
{132}{}{Great! That'll be }
{133}{}{ caps again.}
{134}{}{Keep them comin'.}
{135}{}{Never mind.}
{136}{}{Here. (The bartender slides you a dirty tin cup full of some}
{137}{}{ murky water. After drinking the water, you have a strange}
{138}{}{ taste in your mouth.)}
{139}{}{Here. (The bartender slides you another cup full of the same}
{140}{}{ murky water, and after you drink it, you're reminded as to}
{141}{}{ how strange it tasted the last time...)}
{142}{}{This should be amusing... (The bartender keeps them coming and}
{143}{}{ you lose count. After a while you hear a muffled thump, then}
{144}{}{ you realize you're lying on the floor, face down...)}
{145}{}{Here we go again... (The bartender lines them up while everyone}
{146}{}{ around the bar chants...)}
{147}{}{ ...}
{148}{}{ ...}
{149}{}{ ...}
{150}{}{ (Soon everything begins to fade...)}
{151}{}{Didn't think you looked like someone that could hold their}
{152}{}{ liquor.}
{153}{}{That's a shame. We were all looking forward to seeing you}
{154}{}{ 'perform' again.}
{155}{}{Aww... you're not going to show us your 'stuff' again? Well}
{156}{}{ okay, here's your beer. Anything else?}
{157}{}{Are you sure you can resist the temptation? You were quite an}
{158}{}{ act the last time. Well, here you are. (The bartender hands}
{159}{}{ you a liquor bottle.) Anything else?}
{160}{}{Here you are. (The bartender hands you a beer bottle.) Anything}
{161}{}{ else?}
{162}{}{Get me smashed again!}
{163}{}{Here you are. (The bartender hands you a liquor bottle.)}
{164}{}{ Anything else?}
{165}{}{You have a very bad taste in your mouth.}
{166}{}{You think your head is about to explode.}
