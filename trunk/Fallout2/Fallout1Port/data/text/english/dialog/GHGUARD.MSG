{100}{}{You see a ghoul guard.}
{101}{}{We're going to take you to Set. I think he'll want to talk to you, personally.}
{102}{}{You shouldn't be here...}
{103}{}{Garret told me it was okay. He told me to get something from Set's room for him. Do you know where it is?}
{104}{}{Okay. I'll just be leaving then.}
{105}{}{Huh?}
{106}{}{That doesn't sound right. You'd better come along with me.}
{107}{}{I don't think so.}
{108}{}{Okay.}
{109}{}{I don't think you want to go to that room.}
{110}{}{Why not?}
{111}{}{Okay, I don't want to go into that room. Now what?}
{112}{}{I think you'd better be leaving.}
{113}{}{We are here to make sure that people that don't belong in Set's room don't go into it. Not for Set's safety, actually, but for theirs. Anything else?}
{114}{}{Yeah. Your shoelaces are untied.}
{115}{}{Nah. Thanks.}
{116}{}{I'm on duty. Go away.}
