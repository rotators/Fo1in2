{100}{}{You see a lone Paladin. He seems to be both afraid and angry.}

{104}{}{I'm }
{105}{}{. What's happened to this place?}
{106}{}{My name is not important.}

{107}{}{Be careful, }
{108}{}{, you may hurt yourself. An army of bad mutants came to this place and made a big boom. See?}
{109}{}{Uh-huh.}
{110}{}{See. So, you better find anoter place to go. It isn't safe here.}
{111}{}{Me go.}

{112}{}{Mutants. It was a really big army. They came, killed everyone, took everything they could and blew this place up.}
{113}{}{And how did you manage to survive all this?}
{114}{}{I was returning from a long range patrol. When I came the battle was already over. I couldn't do anything. So I hid and watched them.}
{115}{}{You mean you were too frightened to do anything?}
{116}{}{No one else survived this invasion?}
{117}{}{Look, I may not be the bravest man in Brotherhood, but I'm also not an idiot. There was really nothing, I could possibly do.}
{118}{}{Coward. Now stay and guard a bunch of ruins. I better go and kill some of those mutants of yours.}
{119}{}{Sorry. Did anyone else survived this massacre?}
{120}{}{Several scouting parties, some paladins on patrol... too little to do anything. Brotherhood of Steel is practically dead. I'll stay here for the time being, try to gather as many survivors as I can and tell them what happened here. Then... I actually don't know what's then. Never had a chance to even think about it.}
{121}{}{I understand. Keep up a good work, Paladin, I need to go.}
{122}{}{Good bye, }
{123}{}{. If you'll run into some Brotherhood survivors in your travels, tell them what's happened here.}

{124}{}{Stop right there... Oh, that's you, }
{125}{}{.}
{126}{}{Uh-huh.}
{127}{}{Yes, that's me. What's happened here?}

{130}{}{Good bye, }
{131}{}{. If you'll run into some of our fellow Brothers, tell them what's happened here.}
{132}{}{Sure. I really need to be going now.}

{133}{}{Then you better go. I have nothing to say to you.}

{150}{}{The Paladin ignores you. It seems he's deep in his thoughts.}
