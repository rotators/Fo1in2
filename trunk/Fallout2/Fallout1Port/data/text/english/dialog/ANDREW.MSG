{100}{}{You see: Andrew, the jail guard.}
{101}{}{Okay, you can go now.}
{102}{}{Hey! You! Stop!}
{103}{}{Can I help you?}
{104}{}{Who are you?}
{105}{}{What are you doing?}
{106}{}{No thanks.}
{107}{}{I'm Andrew. My job is to guard the jail.}
{108}{}{I'm guarding the jail. I make sure that miscreants don't get in or out.}
{109}{}{Why would you keep people from getting in the jail?}
{110}{}{Oh.}
{111}{}{You have a good day. And stay out of trouble.}
{112}{}{Someone might leave something to help a prisoner escape. Or someone might get locked inside, and stuck until we could get the keys.}
{113}{}{Eergh!}
{114}{}{Move along, fella.}
{115}{}{Move along, miss.}
{116}{}{Hey! Knock it off!}
