{100}{}{You see a large, well-armed man.}
{101}{}{You see: Gabriel, leader of the Gun Runners.}
{102}{}{It's not often that we get visitors. How can I help you?}
{103}{}{Why don't you get many visitors?}
{104}{}{What is it you do here?}
{105}{}{This place isn't very accessible with a nest of those damn Deathclaws right outside our factory.}
{106}{}{You guys seem fairly well armed, why don't you go exterminate them?}
{107}{}{We've gone over there and taken out a few, but they always seem to come back. Besides, we're machinists, not fighters.}
{108}{}{What would you give me if I went in there and took care of them for you?}
{109}{}{We manufacture weapons and ammunition. We've been at this for the last 30 years. But the last 10 have been hell.}
{110}{}{Why is that?}
{111}{}{We've stripped the area surrounding our factory of all the scrap metals that were left after the war. Now we have to rely on Adytum to supply us with raw materials.}
{112}{}{What's so bad about Adytum supplying you with your materials?}
{113}{}{At first it was fine. They supplied us with raw materials, we manufactured and sold the weapons. Then, 3 years ago, Zimmerman hired some mercenaries to help protect Adytum from the Deathclaw and the odd random attack by raiders. Those Regulators are cold-hearted bastards and are squeezing us for all we have. We make the guns and they get rich off of it.}
{114}{}{Why don't you just leave and set up somewhere else?}
{115}{}{That's rough. What would you give me to take care of the Deathclaw?}
{116}{}{We would if we could, but moving is a major undertaking with all the lathes and mills. These are things that aren't just picked up and easily moved. We could move, but the Deathclaw make it impossible.}
{117}{}{You guys seem fairly well armed, why don't you go exterminate them?}
{118}{}{If you could get rid of the Deathclaws once and for all, you could name your price.}
{119}{}{I want weapons and ammunition, and lots of it.}
{120}{}{}
{121}{}{If you clean out that area, we'll be leaving, but we'll leave behind more weapons and ammunition than you could possibly use.}
{122}{}{Okay. You got yourself a deal.}
{123}{}{I'll have to think about it.}
{124}{}{People who would fix all of your problems with Adytum.}
{125}{}{You clear out the Deathclaws, all of them, and you got yourself a deal.}
{126}{}{Okay. I'll do it.}
{127}{}{I'll have to think about it.}
{128}{}{Hello again.}
{129}{}{What is it you do here?}
{130}{}{Bye.}
{131}{}{}
{132}{}{It's been going okay.}
{133}{}{I think I've killed all the Deathclaws.}
{134}{}{We need to be sure. We've killed over 20 in the past 2 years and they always seem to come back. We could never figure out how. Let's give it a few days and if they are still gone we'll see what we can do for ya'.}
{135}{}{Okay, thanks}
{136}{}{Let us know when you've taken care of the Deathclaws.}
{137}{}{Yeah. See you around, maybe.}
{138}{}{I know, tell me about it.}
{139}{}{See you around, maybe.}
{140}{}{It's not often that we get visitors. May I help you?}
{141}{}{Why is it that you don't get many visitors?}
{142}{}{What is it you do here?}
{143}{}{This place isn't very accessible, with a nest of those damn Deathclaws right outside our factory.}
{144}{}{I've killed all the Deathclaws. Even all the damn eggs.}
{145}{}{We would if we could, but moving is a major undertaking with all the lathes and mills. These are things that aren't just picked up and easily moved. We could move, but the Deathclaws make it impossible.}
{146}{}{I've killed all the Deathclaws. Even all the damn eggs.}
{147}{}{}
{148}{}{I want weapons and ammunition, and lots of it.}
{149}{}{}
{150}{}{No need to pay me. Your thanks is enough.}
{151}{}{You got it - just take whatever you want. We're pulling out of here in a day or two, but we'll leave more weapons and ammo than you could carry right now. Just come back here whenever you need them.}
{152}{}{}
{153}{}{}
{154}{}{Thank you.}
{155}{}{}
{156}{}{No problem.}
{157}{}{}
{158}{}{}
{159}{}{Weren't you guys leaving?}
{160}{}{I'm just here to pick up a few things. What do you got today?}
{161}{}{Nothing. Thanks anyway.}
{162}{}{}
{163}{}{Great. What do you guys got today?}
{164}{}{Well, I'll see you guys later.}
{165}{}{}
{166}{}{I'm just here to pick up a few things. What do you got today?}
{167}{}{Nothing. Thanks anyway.}
{168}{}{Sorry I can't talk to you now, I'm very busy.}
{169}{}{Guns! I like guns!}
