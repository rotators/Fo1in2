{995}{}{No, I don't know anything about that.}

{22715}{}{A myth to scare little children into behaving.}

{27703}{}{Our arch-enemies to the west will be crushed soon!}
{27704}{}{We are the Blades! Never forget it!}
{27705}{}{They were once a gang, but they became soft. They do sell good guns, though.}
{27706}{}{Traders and merchants.}
{27707}{}{I've heard of that place, but not anything about it.}
{27708}{}{A what?}
{27709}{}{Razor is the most accomplished fighter of us all. She will lead us to victory.}

{27712}{}{This is the Boneyard.}

{27901}{}{Hmph. Don't get me started. They don't have the stomach or courage to fight.}
{27902}{}{They're cultists in a big church to the south. They seem harmless but something weird is going on there.}
{27903}{}{The Rippers are like mangy dogs - vicious, inbred, and stupid.}
{27904}{}{See my blade? We make these ourselves. Every one of use makes his own. Hence our name.}
{27905}{}{They came down from the Hub looking for turf, but they decided to become salesmen instead of warriors.}
{27906}{}{That's a trading city to the east. Merchants from there come here sometimes to trade with Adytum and the Gun Runners.}

{27908}{}{A what?}
{27909}{}{Razor is our leader and champion. I have no doubt that her experience will grant us victory at last over those Rippers.}
{27910}{}{Far east of here. Supposedly, ghouls that eat human flesh live there. I wouldn't want to fight the ghouls.}
{27911}{}{That's supposed to be the ruins of some place that got hit straight-on by a nuke. I think it's way to the south.}

{29102}{}{The Cathedral's this big church south of the Boneyard, where some strange cult worships a Dark God. I think they're freaky.}
{29103}{}{The Rippers are all one big family, literally. They're impossible to deal with if they don't know you, so don't even try. They are in a big booby-trapped fortress southwest of us. Watch out for land mines if you're stupid enough to visit.}
{29104}{}{They've converted several small buildings to the southeast into their home. They are pretty well organized and smarter than the Rippers. They sometimes let outsiders join, too. Their leader, Razor, is one tough woman.}
{29105}{}{That's us. Good money in selling guns to the Blades and the Rippers here.}
{29106}{}{That's the trading city east of here where we get our guns and do trading. They send out caravans all over the place. You could probably travel with a caravan when one shows up in Adytum.}
{29107}{}{It's a small frontier town just north of the Hub. There's a great casino there, but the town's sheriff is just a little too overbearing.}
{29108}{}{I have no idea what that is.}
{29109}{}{This is the north side of the Boneyard. It's funny, people from outside use it as a curse - if something's bad, they say it 'Bites the Bone'. But it's not too bad once you get used to it.}
