FALLOUT ET TU
-------------
Fallout to Fallout 2 engine conversion


Fallout et tu (also called Fallout 1@2, 1at2, 1in2, ...) is bringing the first Fallout game into the engine of the second one while utilizing features available in Fallout 2 wherever we can (within reason).

- Install FALLOUT 2 anywhere.
  - The game is **REQUIRED** to play the Fallout 1 in 2 engine conversion!

- Unpack FALLOUT ET TU into your Fallout 2 main folder (i.e. the folder where `master.dat` and `critter.dat` files are located).
  - The folder structure must look like this:
    ```
    \Fallout 2\Fallout1in2\Fallout2.exe
    ```
    For Epic Games version:
    ```
    \fallout2\Fallout 2 English\Fallout1in2\Fallout2.exe
    ```

- Start the `UNDAT.EXE` and select the `MASTER.DAT` file from your FALLOUT 1 installation directory.
  - If you are using a (pre)release package, `UNDAT.EXE` can be found in the `Fallout1in2` folder.
  - If you are using the repository, `UNDAT.EXE` can be found in the `Tools\UndatUI` folder.
  - If you are using Linux, `UNDAT.SH` can be used instead (requires `WINE` installed).
  - If you are using a (pre)release package, `UNDAT.SH` can be found in the `Fallout1in2` folder.
  - If you are using the repository, `UNDAT.SH` can be found in the `Tools/UndatCLI` folder.

- Select the `Fallout1in2` folder as extraction target.

- Extract the files.

That's it. The game can now be played using `Fallout1in2\Fallout2.exe`!

When using Linux with Wine, if there are issues running the game correctly, set the *.dll override priorities in Wine: `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="ddraw.dll=n,b" wine Fallout2.exe`


CONFIGURATION
-------------

Main mod configuration can be found in [config/fo1_settings.ini](config/fo1_settings.ini). It is recommended to check and/or tweak settings in this file _before_ starting a new game. Changing settings mid-game have a chance to corrupt savegames or introduce undefined behavior.

Other interesting files:
- [ddraw.ini](ddraw.ini) (sfall configuration)
- [f2_res.ini](f2_res.ini) (high resolution patch configuration)
- [mods/sfall-mods.ini](mods/sfall-mods.ini) (item highlighting and NPC combat control configuration)
- [config/](config/) directory (misc modifications configuration)


STEAM
-----------------

The mod can be started easily with the Steam client, replacing vanilla FALLOUT 1. We released a small, dedicated tool, which helps keeping manual configuration at minimum.
See https://nma-fallout.com/threads/220425/ for details.
