{100}{}{Du siehst: Griffith.}
{101}{}{Der Ghul trägt eine alte, geflickte Motorradjacke. Du siehst Spuren von Tätowierungen auf seiner verfaulten Haut.}

{125}{}{Du erhältst }
{126}{}{ Erfahrungspunkte dafür, dass du Griffith geholfen hast Necropolis zu verlassen.}
{127}{}{ Erfahrungspunkte für das stehlen des Motorrads.}

# Float: (When using the bike without owning it and having talked to Griffith at least once.)
{150}{}{Ein Original Chryslus Motors Cruiser!}
{160}{}{Du bist ein verdammter DIEB!}
{161}{}{Was zum? Wo ist mein ..?!}

{175}{}{Ich gehe jetzt.}
{176}{}{Ja was auch immer.}
{177}{}{Scheiß auf den Ort.}
{178}{}{Oh man, hier riecht etwas.}
{179}{}{Immer noch hier?}
{180}{}{Mach dich lieber auf den Weg.}

{181}{}{Scheiß auf den Ort.}
{182}{}{Geh' mir aus den Augen.}
{183}{}{Was?}
{184}{}{Geh weg.}
{185}{}{Jemand hat meine Brennstoffsteuerung gestohlen!}

{200}{}{Der Ghul starrt dich nur an.}

# Float when getting the fuel cell controller
{250}{}{Ich muss nur schnell etwas holen, dann bin ich endgültig weg ...}
{251}{}{He-he, was für ein Idiot! Muss nur noch schnell mein' Scheiß aufsammeln und dann tschüss!}

# Angry float
{300}{}{Verpiss dich.}
{301}{}{Verpiss dich, du hast nicht mal Geld!}

# Dialog:
{1000}{}{Hey smoothskin, what'cha lookin at? I tell you what: You're looking at an original Chryslus Motors Cruiser, build... Uhm... Actually, I don't know when it was build, but it's pre-war and in top condition!}
{1001}{}{You're here to talk, smoothskin? }
{1002}{}{You got the caps now or what?}
{1003}{}{Don't push my buttons, smoothskin.}
	{1010}{}{Nice ride. Is the engine still running?}
	{1020}{}{You know, I have seen plenty pictures of motorcycles in our vault library. }
	{1030}{}{Please don't talk to me. Bye.}
	{1040}{}{I got the caps.}
	
{1100}{}{Of course it runs, dummie! Fill it up with energy cells and it'll come alive and roar like a beast!}
	{1110}{}{Why are you telling me this?}
	{1120}{}{I get it, you want to get rid of the bike.}
	{1130}{}{Great, but there is a water chip I have to fetch. See you later.}
	
{1200}{}{Why? Easy. Because you look interested. And I feel we're in a bit of a situation here, which requires me to leave this hole as soon as possible.}
	{1210}{}{Now this place doesn't seem all *that* bad to me.}
	{1220}{}{Why aren't you leaving then?}
	{1230}{}{Are you refering to the mutants occupying the watershed?}
	
{1300}{}{Are you serious? You see'n these green fuckers over there at the watershed? I'd say shit 's about to go down here. Soon. When that happens, I won't be around anymore.}
	{1310}{}{Why aren't you leaving with the bike then?}
	
{1400}{}{Because I'm out of ENERGY CELLS, smoothskin! Even if I wanted to - which I do, very much, believe me - I can't. Don't have the caps and even if, sure as shit you won't find 'cells to buy anywhere around here.}
	{1410}{}{Energy cells, huh? Would these do it for you?}
	{1420}{}{What's the bike going to cost me?}
	{1430}{}{That sucks, but I have to go now. See you later.}
	
{1500}{}{Shit! ... Yeah! But ... I can't pay you.}
	{1510}{}{Just take them and get out my sight before I'll change my mind.}
	{1520}{}{You're right, that's not a good deal. What do you want for the bike?}
	
{1600}{}{Wait, are you..? Really? ... Thanks man! Time to say goodbye to this death infested hole! Do you think there's something up north for the likes of us? Guess I will find out!}
	{1610}{}{[Done]}
	
{1700}{}{You're from a vault, huh? I've been a vault dweller too once! Now look, it only brought the best out of me! Ha-ha! [He flails his boney arms in front of you] }
	{1710}{}{[More]}

{1800}{}{Now, seriously. Seeing as you made it all the way to the watershed, you can't be as incompetent as all the other fools 'round here. That means, I have a proposal for you.}
	{1810}{}{I'm all ears.}

{1900}{}{I'll give you the bike. For the measly sum of 2000 caps, it's aaaall yours. Get it? It's time for me to leave this shithole behind.}
	{1910}{}{2000? That's quite some caps.}
	{1920}{}{I'll give you 1000 caps.}
	{1930}{}{I'll give you 500 caps.}
	{1940}{}{Not interested. }
	{1950}{}{If you want to leave, why not with the bike?}
	{1960}{}{What will you do with the money?}
	{1970}{}{Deal.}

{2000}{}{Are you shitting me? It's a fully working Chryslus Motors Cruiser! Sure as shit won't find any other in that condition for a loooong time!}
	{2010}{}{Alright. Here's your 2000 caps.}
	{2020}{}{That's too steep for me.}

{2100}{}{Deal! ... Now wait here. I'll go and get the fuel cell controller.}
	{2110}{}{The fuel cell controller?}
{2101}{}{You really trying to shit me here, are you? No way you have 2000 caps!}
	{2120}{}{Oh ...}

{2200}{}{What? You think I'll keep the bike standing here on the open road just like that? You think I'm stupid? Without the fuel cell controller you can't start the bike, even with the keys. Now wait here, I'll go and get it.}
	{2210}{}{[Warte]}
{2300}{}{[You wait for Griffith to return.]}
	{2310}{}{[Warte]}
{2400}{}{[That really takes a while.]}
	{2410}{}{[Warte]}
{2500}{}{[Did he just scam you?]}
	{2510}{}{[Warte]}

{2600}{}{Phew. Sure as shit, my lungs aren't the best anymore ... You're still here? Great! Got the controller. Here, take it. I'll make my way to the next caravan out of this shithole.}
	{2610}{}{Pass auf dich auf.}

{2700}{}{Not much, actually. Just the measly sum of 2000 caps. That's all.}
{2701}{}{Aren't you listening? It's 2000 caps!}
{2800}{}{If you say so. Get back to me if you change your mind.}

{3100}{}{I'll hit up the next caravan. Maybe up north? Anywhere is better than here.}

{3200}{}{Look! You're actually smarter than everyone else around here! ... They are just the vanguard. There's more to come, I bet on that.}
	{3210}{}{Alright, I'll buy your bike.}
	{3220}{}{I better keep going then. See you later.}


# Dumb dude
	{4999}{}{Huh?}
{5000}{}{Willst du mich verarschen? Du bist noch dümmer als du aussiehst! Was zur Hölle hat es geschafft, dich hierher zu bringen?}
{5001}{}{Du bist zurück! Was jetzt, Dummie?}
	{5010}{}{Uuuhhh ...}
	{5020}{}{Uh. Ich gehen.}
	{5030}{}{Uhm....}

{5100}{}{Okay, okay, du musst nicht antworten. Verirrt, was? Ich verstehe, Necropolis kann für manche so sein. Mit den stinkenden Abwasserkanälen und all dem ...}
	{5110}{}{[Mehr]}
{5200}{}{Jetzt geh bitte woanders spielen. Vielleicht dort drüben an der Wasserstelle? Die da drüben sollten ungefähr deine Intelligenz haben. Jetzt geh. Husch!}
{5201}{}{... Hey, warte einen Moment! Sind das Energiezellen in deinem Rucksack? Hast du etwas dagegen, sie mir zu geben? Ich ... äh ... will sie ansehen.}
	{5210}{}{Oh!}
	{5220}{}{JA!}
	{5230}{}{NEIN!}

{5300}{}{Bitte?}
	{5310}{}{Ok.}
	{5320}{}{NEIN, NEIN, NEIN!}
