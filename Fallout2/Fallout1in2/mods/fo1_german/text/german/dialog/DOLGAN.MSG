{105}{}{You see a member of the Blades.}
{106}{}{You think that might be Books.}
{107}{}{You think that might be Scars.}

{111}{}{You think that might be Razor.}
{112}{}{Get lost! This is only for real fighters.}
{113}{}{So, you think you can take on Tangler and his wimps?
 Here, I'll teach you to use that blade.}
{114}{}{Now you are a little better at that. Go kick Tangler's
 butt into next year for me.}
{115}{}{Great job on hacking those Rippers. What can I do for you?}
{116}{}{Can you teach me some more blade skills?}
{117}{}{How can I get into the Gun Runners?}
{118}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{119}{}{Sure thing. But it will take most of the day for a little
 improvement. You still want that?}
{120}{}{Yes.}
{121}{}{No.}
{122}{}{There you go. You've shown a little improvement. Good luck
 to you.}
{123}{}{Sure thing. Come back when you want more training.}
{124}{}{Seems like we let in a fool. Well, if you want to get into
 their place, there is a slight break in their moat. Look for
 it and run like mad. You may even make it across.}
{125}{}{Thanks.}
