{113}{}{Try it.}
{114}{}{Sorry about that. Goodbye.}
{115}{}{Can I crash here?}
{116}{}{No. These are for real Blades, not some wuss.}

{118}{}{So, you've volunteered to help. Better than nothing, I reckon. Thanks. Gonna spread the word.}
{119}{}{Yeah, I'll go and see what I can do.}
{120}{}{Hey again. I heard you've actually helped us. You are more than worthy of our respect, indeed. We are free now. (You are now a member of the Blades gang.)}
{121}{}{Can't help you with that. Go talk to Razor.}
