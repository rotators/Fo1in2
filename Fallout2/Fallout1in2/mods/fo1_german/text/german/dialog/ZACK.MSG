{100}{}{Du siehst Zack.}
{101}{}{Du siehst einen Gunrunner.}
{102}{}{Hallo, ich bin Zack. Willst du Waffen kaufen? Zeig' mir, was du zu tauschen hast.}
{103}{}{Nein.}
{104}{}{OK.}
{105}{}{Bekomme ich einen Rabatt?}
{106}{}{Willst du Waffen kaufen? Zeig' mir, was du zu tauschen hast.}
{107}{}{Entschuldige bitte die Störung.}
{108}{}{Freut mich, mit dir Geschäfte zu machen.}
{109}{}{}
{110}{}{OK. Komm' zurück, wenn du irgendetwas brauchst.}
{111}{}{Du solltest dich lieber schnell entscheiden. Bist du hergekommen, um Ausrüstung zu kaufen oder um erschossen zu werden?}
{112}{}{Du hast ein echtes Problem mit deinen Ansichten.}
{113}{}{Tut mir leid, vielleicht kann ich doch etwas Gerät brauchen.}
{114}{}{Was zum Teufel machst du dann hier?}
{115}{}{Nichts.}
{116}{}{Sicher.}
{117}{}{Also, bis Gabriel was sagt, musst du, wie alle, den vollen Preis zahlen.}
{118}{}{Da bin ich mir nicht sicher.}
{119}{}{Zeig' mir trotzdem, was du hast.}
{120}{}{Toll! Zeig' mir, was du hast.}
{121}{}{Ich komme später wegen des Rabatts.}
{122}{}{Bekomm' ich ein besseren Rabatt?}
{123}{}{Tut mir leid, aber ich hab' dir bereits den besten Rabatt gegeben.}

# Fo1in2
   {998}{}{Zack, your gear is top quality, but I am looking for something *even more* special.}
   {999}{}{Can we talk about the *even more* special gear again?}
   
{1000}{}{Sorry, but that's all I got right now.}
{1001}{}{Could try to get our hands on better materials again, now that the Deathclaws don't bother us anymore. It'll take a while, though.}
   {1010}{}{Anything you need help with?}
   
{1100}{}{Paying new scavs will cost. If you want to speed up the process ... an investment of 10.000 caps would probably help.}
   {1110}{}{I don't have that kind of money.}
   {1120}{}{Really hope it'll be worth it, Zack! [Pay 10.000 caps]}
   {1130}{}{Uff. Maybe later.}

{1200}{}{Come back if you have that kind of money.}
{1300}{}{Can't promise anything. You'll have to check back from time to time, because this kind of inventory usually sells fast.}
{1400}{}{Okay.}

# Upgrade Weapons
	{1999}{}{Can you modify or upgrade weapons?}

{2000}{}{Sure as hell can. What do you have?}
{2001}{}{Sure as hell can, but you don't look like you have anything we can tinker with. Bring by some... eh, "normal" pistols and rifles, and we might be able to help you.}
	{2010}{}{Can you do anything with any of these pistols I have?}
	{2020}{}{One of my rifles could use some attachments.}
	{2025}{}{Can you beef up my flamethrower?}
	{2030}{}{Can you do anything with this cattleprod here?}
	{2040}{}{Nevermind. I was interested in something else...}
	{2050}{}{Actually, nothing today.}

{2100}{}{Let me see what you have.} # unused
	{2110}{}{Actually, could you upgrade one of my other weapons instead?}
	{2120}{}{Nevermind. I wanted something else...}
	{2130}{}{Actually, none of them. I have to go.}
	{2140}{}{Too rich for my blood. I'll be back when I have more cash.}

# Pistols
{2200}{}{We can put a speed loader on that magnum there for }
{2201}{}{That Desert Eagle you got... if you want, we can give it an expanded magazine for }
{2202}{}{ Deckel.}
	{2210}{}{Put the speed loader on the magnum.}
	{2220}{}{Expand the magazine in this Desert Eagle here.}

# Rifles
{2300}{}{We can put a scope on that hunting rifle for }
{2301}{}{That assault rifle you got there... We can give it an expanded magazine for }
{2302}{}{I've got a low-light scope that we can put on that advanced assault rifle you got, for }
	{2310}{}{All right then...put a scope on the Colt hunting rifle.}
	{2320}{}{Expand the magazine of the AK-112 assault rifle.}
	{2330}{}{Attach that low-light scope on the AK-198.}

# Melee
{2400}{}{You want that cattleprod juiced up? We can SUPERCHARGE it for }
{2410}{}{Sure.}

# Big Guns
{2500}{}{Lass mal sehen... Yeah, damit können wir was machen, für }
{2510}{}{Cool.}

{2600}{}{Warte hier.}
{2601}{}{There you go. Anything else?}
