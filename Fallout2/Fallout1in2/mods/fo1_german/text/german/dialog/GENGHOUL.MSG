# Examining the ghouls, restored from original Fallout files

{200}{}{You examine the pitiful thing, but cannot figure out what might have made it the way it is.}
{201}{}{It seems to have been human once, or at least descended from humans. You guess that the deterioration in the body is most likely due to acid or radiation.}
{202}{}{The body of the humanoid looks to be highly irradiated, but still functioning. While it was once human, it seems to have reverted to a more animalistic lifestyle.}
{203}{}{The body of the humanoid looks to be highly irradiated, and much of the muscle and brain matter have deteriorated. However, genetic indicators lead you to believe that it descended, like you, from those that entered the Vaults.}
{204}{}{This pitiful thing is highly irradiated. You cannot determine whether it has gone mad from being caged, or has simply lost too much brain matter due to radiation damage.}
{205}{}{The body of the humanoid looks to be highly irradiated, however it has maintained enough brain matter and motor function to be able to speak clearly.}
