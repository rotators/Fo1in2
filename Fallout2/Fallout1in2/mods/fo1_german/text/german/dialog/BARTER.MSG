{101}{}{Hello wanderer! I trade and sell goods to the fine people of Shady Sands. Would you like to see my wares?}
{102}{}{Yes.}
{103}{}{Nope.}
{104}{}{We have been plagued by radscorpions for some time now. All who have been sent to destroy these monsters have not returned. I will give you weapons and armor if you will follow a guide to their lair and kill them all.}
{105}{}{Sounds good.}
{106}{}{No thanks.}
{107}{}{That is a shame. Please leave.}
{108}{}{Excellent. Talk to Seth then; he will guide you to the lair. Here are the items I promised. They will be useful in the lair.}
{109}{}{Please help us as soon as possible. Time is of the essence.}
{110}{}{I don't talk to your kind, stranger.}
{111}{}{Thank you for destroying the radscorpions, stranger.}
