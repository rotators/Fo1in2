{100}{}{You see Julianna.}
{101}{}{You see a simple Adytowner.}
{102}{}{Hello.}
{103}{}{Erf.}
{104}{}{Hello.}
{105}{}{I have a message from Romero.}
{106}{}{May I ask your name, miss?}
{107}{}{I'm Julianna.}
{108}{}{Do you have a job here?}
{109}{}{Can I ask a little about your town?}
{110}{}{I do what Caleb asks. But I am really only able to do a little farming.
 I don't have the skills to help Smitty or Miles out.}
{111}{}{Tell me a bit about those others you mentioned.}
{112}{}{We survive, and the Regulators make sure that nothing happens to hurt us.
 Mostly by not letting us out of here.}
{113}{}{Well, Miles does chemistry, and he makes bullets and things.
 Smitty is a craftsman who builds things like pots and knives.}
{114}{}{You have a message from Romero? What is it?}
{115}{}{He says that he's through with you.}
{116}{}{He says that he sends his love.}
{117}{}{He sent this locket as a token.}
{118}{}{No . . . it can't be true . . . I . . .}
{119}{}{Did he do nothing else?}
{120}{}{No, sorry.}
{121}{}{Oh yeah, he sent this locket.}
{122}{}{How romantic! Oh, I must see him somehow! If only . . .
 perhaps . . . maybe Lorraine can bring him a message . . .}
{123}{}{Oh! Thank you so much for your help! We have decided
 to live here now, with the Followers, in peace.
 Thank you for supporting our love.}
{124}{}{I cannot live without him!}
{125}{}{Julianna draws a knife and plunges it into herself!}
{126}{}{You gain 250 for assisting the star-crossed lovers with the delivery of
 Romero's locket to Julianna.}
