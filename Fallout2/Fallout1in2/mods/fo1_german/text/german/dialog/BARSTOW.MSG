{102}{}{Urrrooo?}
{103}{}{What is the meaning of the universe?}
{104}{}{I'm hurt pretty bad. Think you can help me?}
{105}{}{How do you fix the water pump?}
{106}{}{Can you tell me something about this place?}
{107}{}{I am ill-suited for that. Perhaps if you talk to Laura, she will be willing give you the information you need to know.}

{109}{}{I don't have the tools to assist you with that problem. Please talk to one of my superiors.}
{110}{}{Oh, that. That's just a flag.}  # "flag" in this case being a boolean or variable. Programmer joke :)  -Sduibek
