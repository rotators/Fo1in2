{100}{}{You see Amber, a teacher for the Followers.}
{101}{}{Now is when I rest. Please, come back during the evening.}
{102}{}{Welcome noble traveler. Have you come here to study?}
{103}{}{No. I really came here just to kill things.}
{104}{}{Depends on what you want to teach me.}
{105}{}{Yes, I am willing to learn.}
{106}{}{I am truly sorry to hear that. The Followers believe in peace at all
 costs. For that reason, I have renounced violence. Good evening.}
{107}{}{I am skilled in many of the languages and arts. Perhaps you would like
 to learn one of those?}
{108}{}{I'm sorry, but I need to know things which will help me survive.}
{109}{}{I have no time for that type of stuff. I'm gone.}
{110}{}{Perhaps I can listen to a song or two.}
{111}{}{Can you teach me anything else?}
{112}{}{Ah, we have here a student of life. In a case like this, I can teach you
 some herbalism, but training takes a while for little result.}
{113}{}{Fine, just teach me.}
{114}{}{Please, teach me what you can.}
{115}{}{Sorry, I really don't have time for plants. Goodbye.}
{116}{}{You need not be rude. Apologize now, or I won't teach you.}
{117}{}{I am sorry. Will you please teach me?}
{118}{}{Forget it.}
{119}{}{That is better now. We will begin your studies.}
{120}{}{You are an apt learner. May your trials be light. Go in peace.}
{121}{}{As you see fit. May the future soften your heart and broaden your mind.}
{122}{}{Very well, I will teach you the ways to survive.}
{123}{}{You are an apt learner. May your trials be light. Go in peace.}
{124}{}{You do not convince me. I think you seek to use my gifts for ill.
 Good evening.}
{125}{}{Ah, a student of the arts is a rare thing in this world. Perhaps there
 is hope for you yet. Each song is long in time. Which would you like to hear?}
{126}{}{In the Wake of the Shadow.}
{127}{}{The Ballad of Aires.}
{128}{}{In Remembrance of Artemis.}
{129}{}{The Rising of Dawn's Chariot.}
{130}{}{An astonishing piece of work. I shall grant you an audience.}
{131}{}{I must rest. This teaching drains much from me. Good luck to you.}
{132}{}{An astonishing piece of work. I shall grant you an audience.}
{133}{}{I must rest. This teaching drains much from me. Good luck to you.}
{134}{}{An astonishing piece of work. I shall grant you an audience.}
{135}{}{I must rest. This teaching drains much from me. Good luck to you.}
{136}{}{An astonishing piece of work. I shall grant you an audience.}
{137}{}{I must rest. This teaching drains much from me. Good luck to you.}
{138}{}{I fear I have spent myself far too much. I am sorry.}
{139}{}{Peace and Beauty are all I can teach. I am sorry that those are not
 appealing to you. Good day.}
{140}{}{I can teach you the ways of the old bards and minstrels.}
{141}{}{I would be honored to hear a song.}
{142}{}{Perhaps another time. Thank you.}
{143}{}{I was hoping to learn something that may help me more.}
{144}{}{You have no need of my talents. You have taught peaceful people the
 ways of war. I mourn for them now.}
