{8855}{}{Fuck! You bastard!}
{8856}{}{Nobody hits me like that, and lives.}
{8857}{}{Soon as I catch my breath (cough, cough) I'm coming for you.}
{8858}{}{You tore something up inside me.}
{8859}{}{You don't know what you just started.}
#
# target hit in right leg
#
{8860}{}{Ow, my leg.}
{8861}{}{I don't need to stand to kill you!}
{8862}{}{My knee!}
{8863}{}{My achilles tendon!}
{8864}{}{Aaiiiieeee!!}
{8865}{}{There goes my foxtrot.}
{8866}{}{I'll teach you to tear my toes off.}
{8867}{}{Break my leg? I'll tear you apart!}
{8868}{}{Where's a tourniquet when you need one.}
{8869}{}{Fuck, my leg hurts.}
#
# target hit in left leg
#
{8870}{}{Ow, my leg.}
{8871}{}{I don't need to stand to kill you!}
{8872}{}{My knee!}
{8873}{}{That's going to give me a nice limp for a while.}
{8874}{}{Come here, don't make me hobble after you.}
{8875}{}{Damn near tore my leg off.}
{8876}{}{That's going to slow me up for the whole season.}
{8877}{}{That'll bench me for sure.}
{8878}{}{I've got another leg.}
{8879}{}{Hah-hah, that was my prosthetic leg anyhow.}
#
# target hit in eyes
#
{8880}{}{I can't see!}
{8881}{}{This fight is getting worse by the second.}
{8882}{}{That was a real cheap shot!}
{8883}{}{I'm fuckin' blind here!}
{8884}{}{You prick, you blinded me!}
{8885}{}{Just for that, I'm going to pop your eyes like ripe grapes.}
{8886}{}{You tore my fucking eye out!}
{8887}{}{Crap, my eye's dangling by the optic nerve here.}
{8888}{}{I can still hear where you are.}
{8889}{}{Don't you ever touch my fucking eyes again!}
#
# target hit in groin
#
{8890}{}{Oooooo, my groin!}
{8891}{}{I'll feel that in the morning.}
{8892}{}{Fucking coward!}
{8893}{}{Urp!}
{8894}{}{That won't help you any.}
{8895}{}{Figures that you'd try that.}
{8896}{}{Gettin' your jollies?}
{8897}{}{I'm gonna tear yours off and make you eat them.}
{8898}{}{I think I need to sit down for a while.}
{8899}{}{Got to try harder than that, my cup caught most of it.}
