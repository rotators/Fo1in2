{100}{}{Just because you've got a weapon drawn doesn't mean that I'm gonna give you what you want...}
{101}{}{You've beaten me! What more do you want, dammit?}
{102}{}{I don't got nothing to say! Talk is for the weak!}
{103}{}{I don't know who you are, but I'll give you a fair warning: anyone who messes with the Khans dies messy.}
{104}{}{You know, if you really thought you were stronger, you'd kill me.}
{105}{}{Too bad. I'm messing with you!}
{106}{}{Fine. Let's not mess with each other, and we'll be happy.}
{107}{}{I surrender. Please don't kill me!}
{108}{}{Hngrrr!}
{109}{}{Huh?}
{110}{}{Hail brother Khan! How goes the hunt? Have many weaklings died today?}
{111}{}{Hail sister Khan! How goes the hunt? Have many weaklings died today?}
{112}{}{I will save my boasts for the campfire, but I have many tales to tell!}
{113}{}{I have seen much blood and taken much plunder.}
{114}{}{Not bad. How about you?}
{115}{}{I've done better...}
{116}{}{You are an enemy of the Khans! You attack our warriors and take our women! Give me a reason why I shouldn't cut out your heart!}
{117}{}{Cut the bravado. Where's Tandi? Tell me, or you die!}
{118}{}{Can't think of anything. Let's fight!}
{119}{}{Because we'll both live if you don't try.}
{120}{}{I'm in no condition to fight. I surrender.}
{121}{}{Are you one of them? One of the mutants?}
{122}{}{What do you know about mutants?}
{123}{}{Yeah, I'm a mutant!}
{124}{}{Do I look like a mutant to you?}
{125}{}{No.}
{126}{}{Perhaps. If you wish to fight, I'll fight. If you wish to go in peace, you have my word as a Khan that I will not attack.}
{127}{}{Let's fight.}
{128}{}{Let's not fight.}
{129}{}{Word of a Khan? What a joke!}
{130}{}{You are too strong for me, and I am tired by many days in the wastes. I do not wish to die. Though it shames me, I surrender.}
{131}{}{I agree. I give my word that you may go in peace, provided that you do not provoke me. Do not trouble me again.}
{132}{}{I don't want anything that belongs to a coward, including your life! Get out of my sight!}
{133}{}{You stupid animal. I shall enjoy killing you.}
{134}{}{Uh, yes...}
{135}{}{I shall enjoy hearing them. Farewell, brother!}
{136}{}{I shall enjoy hearing them. Farewell, sister!}
{137}{}{Really? Then I must have it for my own!}
{138}{}{Yes, I have heard that fortune heavily favors you. It is for that reason alone that I do not challenge you for your spoils. Farewell, my brother! May we next meet side by side in battle.}
{139}{}{Yes, I have heard that fortune heavily favors you. It is for that reason alone that I do not challenge you for your spoils. Farewell, my sister! May we next meet side by side in battle.}
{140}{}{I am tired and weary from a journey many days longer than I expected. Radscorpions killed my companions. I long for the comforts of the camp and the healing caress of our women.}
{141}{}{May fortune again find favor with you. Farewell, my brother.}
{142}{}{May fortune again find favor with you. Farewell, my sister.}
{143}{}{They have destroyed Shady Sands. They kill anyone in their path. I never dreamt such ferocity existed. We are all doomed...}
{144}{}{Murdering dog!}
{145}{}{No, but it is hard to tell. I have heard that they cloak themselves in night, that they cloud men's minds, and take the form of beautiful women! We are all doomed!}
{146}{}{That is good. I long to avenge our dead, and even the dead of Shady Sands. Any mutant that crosses my path will die! Go forth, friend! Go forth and kill! Death to the mutants!}
{147}{}{You will die for those words!}
