{100}{}{You see a desert raider with a pleasant smile and an odd assortment of tools.}
{101}{}{I am Diana. How might I help you today?}
{102}{}{I'm looking for a woman named Tandi. Have you seen her?}
{103}{}{Never mind, thanks.}
{104}{}{How about a date?}
{105}{}{What do you do here?}
{106}{}{What can you tell me about this camp?}
{107}{}{Eurrreh?}
{108}{}{If she is one of those women from Shady Sands, maybe you should look there. I just work here.}
{109}{}{Oh. Well, thank you anyway.}
{110}{}{Can you fix my equipment for me?}
{111}{}{As you can see, I am much too busy at the moment to grant you your request.}
{112}{}{Garl has me fixing the camp equipment at the moment. I do not have time to fix our gear and that of every stranger who walks in. Sorry.}
{113}{}{I am the armorer for this encampment. I am the only one with the necessary skills to repair and maintain the weapons and equipment of Garl's men.}
{114}{}{Can you fix my equipment for me?}
{115}{}{What can you tell me about this camp?}
{116}{}{It is run by Garl Death-Hand. He is a fearsome and remorseless leader. He makes sure that we all survive the harsh reality of the desert.}
{117}{}{I'm looking for a woman named Tandi. Have you seen her?}
{118}{}{Can you fix my equipment for me?}
{119}{}{I am busy now. Please go elsewhere.}
{120}{}{You are that new friend of Garl's, are you not? What do you want?}
{121}{}{Hmm. Your equipment seems to be functional. I have more important tasks.}
