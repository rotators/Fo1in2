 persistent, burning itch has gone away.}

{4700}{}{This is where we live. You should understand that.}
{4701}{}{Yes, our Vault needs water. Getting a replacement Water Chip is crucial for all our survival!}
{4702}{}{A good man doing a difficult job.}
{4703}{}{The chip controls the level of purity in the underground water supply. It is a critical piece of equipment that cannot be repaired.}
{4704}{}{The medic is on the first floor, in the medlab. Go there if you are hurt.}
{4705}{}{The library is on the west wing of the third floor. That's where the research computers are located.}
{4706}{}{I don't know. Maybe you could ask if you get a few more supplies from the storage?}
{4707}{}{From what I've heard, it's really dangerous out there.}
{4708}{}{Oh no, did the radiation made you forget where you are?}
{4709}{}{You've seen the movies, right? Don't drink glowing water when you're outside!}
{4710}{}{It's true, people are scared and started hording water. Some even tried stealing from the storage room!}
{4711}{}{They were talking after you left the Vault. Is it true the cave is home to really, really big rats?}
{4712}{}{You must really miss your own bed after being outside for so long!}
{4713}{}{If you're looking for him, the Overseer should be in the Command Center right now.}
{4714}{}{Sorry, but I don't want to talk about this.}
{4715}{}{I think she is somewhere in the Living Quarters.}
{4716}{}{It's really a shame what happened to him!}
{4717}{}{I haven't seen him much lately. Maybe he is in his room over at the Living Quarters?}
{4718}{}{Oh, I don't talk much to her anymore.}
{4719}{}{We keep water reserves in the storage room now. A guard is making sure nobody steals any!}
{4720}{}{They say the outside world is still too radiated for us to be safe.}
{4721}{}{Sorry, I really don't know.}

{7105}{}{What? I'm sorry.}

{7112}{}{If you're looking for a drink, the Skum Pitt at town's north end is your place to be. Looking to buy or sell? Killian's store is right in the middle of town. Of course there is also Gizmo's casino on the west side, if you're looking to lose.}

{7703}{}{Well, it's a really small community to the north. The people who live there are mostly farmers. We occasionally trade with them, but they mostly want to be left alone.}
{7704}{}{The Hub is the center of commerce around here. Almost all of the traders come from the Hub. They have some companies there that still make things. If you want, you can go with one of their trading parties back to the Hub.}
{7705}{}{I don't know anything about that.}
{7706}{}{Gizmo runs it. Watch out for the slot machines, you can lose a lot of money if you play them.}
{7707}{}{Darkwater's? It's in the center of town. You can barter with him, or pay cash.}
{7708}{}{I hear people talking about it, but I've never seen it. They say it roams the desert, striking mostly at night.}

{8303}{}{Well, it's a really small community to the north. The people who live there are mostly farmers. We occasionally trade with them, but they mostly want to be left alone.}
{8304}{}{The Hub is the center of commerce around here. Almost all of the traders come from the Hub. They have some companies there that still make things. If you want, you can go with one of their trading parties back to the Hub.}
{8305}{}{I don't know anything about that.}
{8306}{}{Gizmo runs it. Watch out for the slot machines, you can lose a lot of money if you play them.}
{8307}{}{Darkwater's? It's in the center of town. You can barter with him, or pay cash.}
{8308}{}{I dunno, but the name scares me.}
{8309}{}{If you're hurt, Doc Morbid can surely help you. His clinic is south of here.}
{8310}{}{Killian Darkwater runs the General Store. There you'll probably find what you need.}
{8311}{}{We've got some guards on patrol in the wastes. It's a dangerous place, but we manage.}
{8312}{}{Killian's store is right around the corner. If you're looking for a drink, the Skum Pitt is a to the north of here. There's also Gizmo's casino if you're looking for fun.}
{8313}{}{I'm happy it hasn't been raining like that in a while.}
{8314}{}{They'll hang you if you get caught stealing.}
{8315}{}{The City of the Dead, right? We've only heard some stories and rumors.}
{8316}{}{It's a place somewhere far south for all I know.}
{8317}{}{You know... Stuff.}
{8318}{}{That's our resident bar. The food's okay, but the beer's great.}
{8319}{}{Why do you ask? Do you want to cause trouble?}
{8320}{}{Luckily we don't run into much problems with them down here. Heard it's much worse up north.}
{8321}{}{If you need a place to sleep, check with the Crash House.}
{8322}{}{I sure could use one now.}
{8323}{}{Did you ever try our special meat jerky? Better than iguana for sure.}
{8324}{}{I don't know, did you try talking to Gizmo yet?}
{8325}{}{He is one of the Skulz.}
{8326}{}{He is the owner of the Skum Pitt.}

{8900}{}{I have no idea what you are talking about.}
{8901}{}{A terribly low point in the human history which formed our present world. We preserve the knowledge from the War to prevent another holocaust.}
{8902}{}{A difficult and sorrowful decision. We lost a great many people who chose to go off on their own rather than traveling with the main force searching for a safe haven to live.}
{8903}{}{I don't know much about it. The reports I've hear is that they are amassing somewhere to the north of us.}
{8904}{}{That is where we stand.}
{8905}{}{Those Water Merchants are thieving bastards, but of the other groups, I have no opinion.}
{8906}{}{I don't know anything about that.}
{8907}{}{A slime pit for those vile merchants. Though, occasionally, we will let one of the more civil trading companies exchange goods with us.}
{8908}{}{They are a cult.}
{8909}{}{They are the future of the Brotherhood.}
{8910}{}{They are the keepers of the knowledge.}
{8911}{}{They are the ones who make the weapons for the Brotherhood.}
{8912}{}{They are the protectors of the Brotherhood.}
{8913}{}{I have no idea what you are talking about.}
{8914}{}{You'll find Dr. Lorri on level 2. If you need equipment, talk to }
{8915}{}{Lately, General Maxson is mostly in his room on level 4. Not sure what's going on with the other Elders.}
{8916}{}{Head Paladin Rhombus? You'll find him on level 1.}
{8917}{}{Oh, Vree is in the library on level 3.}
{8918}{}{If you're hurt, Dr. Lorry can help you. See her in the infirmary on level 2.}
{8919}{}{Every once in a while we're trading with a few outside merchants, but that's it.}
{8920}{}{We don't fear the outside world.}
{8921}{}{Dr. Lorri should be in the infirmary on level 2.}
{8922}{}{Our Powered Armor protects us from outside radiation.}
{8923}{}{Brothers have been expelled for lesser crimes.}
{8924}{}{Not everyone gets their hands on a suit of powered armor! Usually it involves indepth training, but I guess the Elders do make exceptions at times.}
{8925}{}{Talus is the second-in-command to Head Paladin Rhombus.}
{8926}{}{You know, where we store historical records and such? The library is on level 3. Vree should be somewhere around there, too.}
{8927}{}{He runs the supply room on level 1. If you need something, you'll have to get past him first.}
{8928}{}{I guess you'll find him in the workshop on level 3 running maintenance on some tech-project.}
{8929}{}{Do you see cattle pens around here?}
{8930}{}{No idea.}
{8931}{}{About ten years ago, we sent out Knights to scout the place, but all they found was ruins. No one knows what happened.}

{18100}{}{You're in Adytum, outsider.}
{18101}{}{The Followers live in an old library just to the north. They preach tolerance and peace.}
{18102}{}{The Cathedral is a ways to the south, by the bay. The Children are a peaceful religion.}
{18103}{}{They're on the west side. They are very vicious and have lots of traps.}
{18104}{}{They're on the east side. They use some sort of high-tech knives.}
{18105}{}{They're past the Followers to the north. They sell weapons to the gangs.}
{18106}{}{We trade with them. They're the largest city I know of.}
{18107}{}{They're a small city northeast of us.}
{18108}{}{Never heard of it.}
{18109}{}{Tine's store is underground near the gate. He can sell you many supplies.}
{18110}{}{He's the mayor. He does a good job.}
{18111}{}{It's a city of the dead, several days to the east.}
{18112}{}{I hear it's way, way south.}
{18113}{}{They protect us from the gangs and keep the peace.}
{18114}{}{They go outside to search for stuff.}
{18115}{}{Are you an idiot? The Boneyard is here; you're in it.}
{18116}{}{There was a small hospital with a doctor up until a few years ago. The Regulators rightfully took him down him for stealing from us!}
{18117}{}{Growing up in the Boneyard is tough. If the lack of food doesn't kill you, the drugs or the gangs probably will.}
{18118}{}{There's the Followers to the north, the Blades are hanging out east of here.}
{18119}{}{The Regulators will shoot thieves on the spot.}
{18120}{}{If you're traveling with brahmin, the gangs will certainly make you a target.}
{18121}{}{That's the old Ripper's place.}
{18122}{}{I've heard there's a nest of them somewhere to the east of the Blades, but I haven't seen it myself.}
{18123}{}{People talk a lot.}
{18124}{}{The fortune-teller? He is in his tent south east of Adytum.}
{18125}{}{He's the leader of the Regulators. Usually you can find him somewhere near the entrance.}
{18126}{}{Maybe talk to Jon Zimmermann?}

{18301}{}{The Followers are a learned and peaceful people. They live in an old library north of here.}
{18302}{}{The Children worship a mysterious Dark God. They seem harmless, but there is something strange about their religion. The Cathedral is south of here.}
{18303}{}{The Rippers are all inbred. They have a fortified building with traps around it where they take prisoners to be tortured and killed.}
{18304}{}{The Blades are notorious for their vibro-knives. They are the arch-enemies of the Rippers. Their leader is a woman named Razor.}
{18305}{}{They used to be a gang, but they set up in a warehouse on the north side and started trading weapons and guns to people.}
{18306}{}{The Hub is a center of trade and commerce. They have companies that actually produce things. They're north of us.}
{18307}{}{Junktown is a moderate-sized city east of here and just north of the Hub.}
{18308}{}{Sorry, can't help you with that.}
{18309}{}{Tine runs the general store near the front gate. He can sell you weapons and traveling supplies.}
{18310}{}{Jon is our mayor. He makes trade agreements, dictates policy, and delegates responsibility to the Regulators and the scavs.}
{18311}{}{The city of the dead? It's supposedly a place inhabited by strange cannibals far to the east. I wouldn't visit there if I were you.}
{18312}{}{It's a big radioactive place far, far to the south, or so I'm told.}
{18313}{}{They're the police force of Adytum. They protect us from the gangs. Caleb is the leader.}
{18314}{}{The scavs have the job of searching the Boneyard for valuable equipment. They are led by Sammael.}
{18315}{}{The Angel's Boneyard is the remains of the old city of Los Angeles. We're in the middle of the Boneyard.}
{18316}{}{There was a small hospital with a doctor down the road up until a few years ago. The Regulators took him down for supplying drugs and chems to the vicious gangs.}
{18317}{}{Growing up in the Boneyard is tough. If the lack of food doesn't kill you, the drugs or the gangs probably will.}
{18318}{}{There's the Followers to the north, the Blades are hanging out east of here. If you make it through the old Cinema north of here, there's also the Gun Runners.}
{18319}{}{There sure is lots of crime in the Boneyard. The Regulators try their best to keep it all out of Adytum.}
{18320}{}{Merchant parties pay good money for protection around here, otherwise they'll lose their brahmin quickly.}
{18321}{}{It's where the Rippers had their hideout before something drove them away.}
{18322}{}{I've heard there's a nest of them somewhere to the east of the Blades, but I haven't seen it myself.}

{18900}{}{A small town to the south. They are good people, if a trifle paranoid. Some of them work with us from time to time.}
{18901}{}{We are the Followers of the Apocalypse. It is our duty to bring peace and learning once again to the world, and to make sure that the weapons of war never again scar the earth.}
{18902}{}{The Cathedral is a great building south of the Boneyard. The Children are a cult worshipping a dark and evil god. They must be stopped before they spread their religion through violence.}
{18903}{}{Inbreds and jackals. They attack anything in sight that isn't related to them. They live west of here in a fortress surrounded by traps.}
{18904}{}{A singularly dangerous group living to the east, who fight with vibro-knives. Their leader, Razor, came from the Hub and molded them into a fierce family.}
{18905}{}{They are a gang living in a warehouse to the north, inside a moat of radioactive sludge. They sell guns to the other gangs.}
{18906}{}{The Hub is a vast mercantile city far to the east of us. They send caravans to many places, including Adytum.}
{18907}{}{It's a small city north of the Hub. I'm told it's a good place to stop for the weary traveler.}
{18908}{}{Although I've read about Vault technology, it's a little beyond me.}
{18909}{}{Nicole is our leader. She's compelled by insight and spirituality to bring peace to a world broken by war.}
{18910}{}{This is the heart of the Angel's Boneyard, named for the old city of Los Angeles, and for the skeletons of the dead that littered the place after the Bomb.}
{18911}{}{The city of the dead? We've heard things from merchant parties, but I've never been there myself.}
{18912}{}{It's a big radioactive place far, far to the south, or so I'm told.}
{18913}{}{They're the so called 'police force' of Adytum. Better stay clear of them, as they cannot be trusted.}
{18914}{}{The scavs have the job of searching the Boneyard for valuable equipment. They are led by Sammael.}
{18915}{}{The Angel's Boneyard is the remains of the old city of Los Angeles. We're in the middle of the Boneyard.}
{18916}{}{I'm sorry but there's nobody around who can really help you with that.}
{18917}{}{Growing up in the Boneyard is tough. If the lack of food doesn't kill you, the drugs or the gangs probably will.}
{18918}{}{There's the Followers to the north, the Blades are hanging out east of here. If you make it through the old Cinema north of here, there's also the Gun Runners.}

{18924}{}{If you're looking to trade supplies, you should probably visit Adytum. If it's about weapons, maybe the Gun Runners east of the old Cinema can help you out.}

{22700}{}{The police are run by Sheriff Greene to keep law and order in the Hub. There are some who believe them to be more of a hindrance than help.}
{22701}{}{They control all of the water in the Hub. They seized control of the Water Tower, and now people have to pay them to get water.}
{22702}{}{A crazed group of traders who take great risks in order to get to the top.}
{22703}{}{A medium tempered group of traders who offer fair prices without having to seek out danger to themselves.}
{22704}{}{A religious cult who worships something called the Master. They run a hospital on the southeast side of town by the Water Merchants.}
{22705}{}{Creepy place. Some say that it is haunted by mutated humans who eat normal people's brains for food. It is somewhere to the east of the Hub.}
{22706}{}{There are some stories which say there is a place to the southeast of here which got hit by a nuclear warhead.}
{22707}{}{That's to the north of us. There is a fair amount of trading between us and them. From rumors, Killian and Gizmo are at each other's throats.}
{22708}{}{That place is the northwest of here. They are a bunch of techno freaks who worship technology. Very spooky people.}
{22709}{}{A primitive town that is far to the north of here. Not much is known about them, because they don't have enough money to trade with us.}
{22710}{}{That rat infested place is riddled with gang warfare. Were it not for the great trading with Adytum and the Gun Runners, I doubt any trader would venture there.}
{22711}{}{Those store the water for the Hub. The Water Merchants control the towers.}
{22712}{}{Old Town is on the northeastern side of town. Only people that hang out there are skags and muties. I've heard that there is a so-called 'Circle of Thieves' somewhere in there.}
{22713}{}{That's where all the merchants sell things. The Weapon Shop, The Armory, Friendly Lending Company and Maltese Falcon are all in that area.}
{22714}{}{That is where all the rich merchants live. The Water Merchants' leader, Daren Hightower has a huge place there.}
{22715}{}{A myth to scare little children into behaving.}
{22716}{}{I don't know anything about that.}
{22717}{}{The three biggest caravan companies in the Hub are the Crimson Caravan, Far Go Trader, and the Water Merchants.}
{22718}{}{Isn't that what these Children of the Cathedral people keep talking about?}
{22719}{}{You're standing right in the Hub's main entrance!}
{22720}{}{It's a small village down in the Boneyard.}
{22721}{}{They produce and sell weapons.}
{22722}{}{The Children of the Cathedral are running a hospital on the southeast side of town by the Water Merchants.}
{22723}{}{With the caravans traversing the wastes all the time nowadays, the trade in the Hub is booming.}
{22724}{}{If you follow the road south, you'll get to the Downtown district. From there, go west and you'll find the Heights. Old Town is to the east, and the Water Merchants are to the south.}
{22725}{}{They say there's a 'Circle of Thieves' in the Hub. Sounds like bullshit to me. I mean... Sheriff Greene would have taken them down already if that were true.}
{22726}{}{Brahmins are very important to the Hub. Without them, we wouldn't be where we are today.}
{22727}{}{Pretty sure the Brotherhood of Steel are responsible for the missing caravans.}
{22728}{}{The skags and muties hang out in Old Town. You want to stay clear of them.}
{22729}{}{The Sheriff runs the local police force to keep law and order in the Hub.}
{22730}{}{The All-N-One store is pricy, but the best General Store in the Market district.}
{22731}{}{If you're looking for new weaponry, Beth's shop is the best in the Market district.}
{22732}{}{Short on caps? The Friendly Lending Company can help you out.}
{22733}{}{The Maltese Falcon is a nightclub on the west side of Downtown.}
{22734}{}{Head the road down south to the Merchant Market. The Weapon Shop, The Armory, Friendly Lending Company and Maltese Falcon are all in that area.}
{22735}{}{I guess you'll easily find work at one of the bigger caravan companies. There's the Far Go Traders, the Crimson Caravan, or the Water Merchants right down the road.}
{22736}{}{Caravans keep disappearing and nobody knows what exactly happens to them. Seems the Far Go Traders are the most unlucky, though.}
{22737}{}{He owns the Maltese Falcon over at the Merchant Market.}
{22738}{}{Butch owns the Far Go Traders, a good man. You'll find him in his office in the Downtown district.}

{27520}{}{Yeah, I'm hungry too.}
{27521}{}{Best stay away from there is all I know.}

{27900}{}{Don't be fooled. Adytum looks like a little village, but their Regulators are tough.}
{27901}{}{Hmph. Don't get me started. They don't have the stomach or courage to fight.}
{27902}{}{They're cultists in a big church to the south. They seem harmless but something weird is going on there.}
{27903}{}{The Rippers are like mangy dogs - vicious, inbred, and stupid.}
{27904}{}{See my blade? We make these ourselves. Every one of use makes his own. Hence our name.}
{27905}{}{They came down from the Hub looking for turf, but they decided to become salesmen instead of warriors.}
{27906}{}{That's a trading city to the north. Merchants from there come here sometimes to trade with Adytum and the Gun Runners.}
{27907}{}{I think it's northeast of here. It's a small city.}
{27908}{}{A what?}
{27909}{}{Razor is our leader and champion. I have no doubt that her experience will grant us victory at last over those Rippers.}
{27910}{}{Far east of here. Supposedly, ghouls that eat human flesh live there. I wouldn't want to fight the ghouls.}
{27911}{}{That's supposed to be the ruins of some place that got hit straight-on by a nuke. I think it's way to the south.}
{27912}{}{This is the Boneyard.}
{27913}{}{They're the police force of Adytum. They hunt us and shoot on sight. That bastard Caleb is the leader.}
{27914}{}{The scavs have the job of searching the Boneyard for valuable equipment. They are led by Sammael.}
{27915}{}{The Angel's Boneyard is the remains of the old city of Los Angeles. We're in the middle of the Boneyard.}
{27916}{}{We had a doctor once. The Regulators got to him and executed him for 'stealing supplies' ... Truth is, he just didn't agree to only work for them.}
{27917}{}{Growing up in the Boneyard is tough. If the lack of food doesn't kill you, the drugs or the gangs probably will.}
{27918}{}{Adytum is south of here. There's the Followers to the north west. If you make it through the old Cinema east of here, there's also the Gun Runners.}
{27919}{}{There sure is lots of crime in the Boneyard. I know we get the blame for some, but the Regulators are much worse if you ask me.}
{27920}{}{Merchant parties pay good money for protection around here, otherwise they'll lose their brahmin quickly.}
{27921}{}{It's where the Rippers had their hideout before something drove them away.}
{27922}{}{I've heard there's a nest of them somewhere to the east of here, but I haven't seen it myself.}
{27923}{}{Some say the Deathclaw has occupied the old Cinema.}
{27924}{}{The big boss of the Regulators. Usually doesn't set a foot out of Adytum. Bet he knows we would try to hit on him.}

{29101}{}{They try to convert everyone to their ways of peace while they hide in their library to the south. They don't help business any!}
{29102}{}{The Cathedral's this big church south of the Boneyard, where some strange cult worships a Dark God. I think they're freaky.}
{29103}{}{The Rippers are all one big family, literally. They're impossible to deal with if they don't know you, so don't even try. They are in a big booby-trapped fortress southwest of us. Watch out for land mines if you're stupid enough to visit.}
{29104}{}{They've converted several small buildings to the southeast into their home. They are pretty well organized and smarter than the Rippers. They sometimes let outsiders join, too. Their leader, Razor, is one tough woman.}
{29105}{}{That's us. Good money in selling guns to the Blades and the Rippers here.}
{29106}{}{That's the trading city north of here where we get our guns and do trading. They send out caravans all over the place. You could probably travel with a caravan when one shows up in Adytum.}
