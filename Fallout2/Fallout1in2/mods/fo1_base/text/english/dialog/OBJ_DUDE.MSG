{4701}{}{Yes, our Vault needs water. Getting a replacement Water Chip is crucial for all our survival!}
{4702}{}{A good man doing a difficult job.}
{4703}{}{The chip controls the level of purity in the underground water supply. It is a critical piece of equipment that cannot be repaired.}
{4704}{}{The medic is on the first floor, in the medlab. Go there if you are hurt.}
{4705}{}{The library is on the west wing of the third floor. That's where the research computers are located.}
{4706}{}{I don't know. Maybe you could ask if you get a few more supplies from the storage?}
{4707}{}{From what I've heard, it's really dangerous out there.}
{4708}{}{Oh no, did the radiation made you forget where you are?}
{4709}{}{You've seen the movies, right? Don't drink glowing water when you're outside!}
{4710}{}{It's true, people are scared and started hording water. Some even tried stealing from the storage room!}
{4711}{}{They were talking after you left the Vault. Is it true the cave is home to really, really big rats?}
{4712}{}{You must really miss your own bed after being outside for so long!}
{4713}{}{If you're looking for him, the Overseer should be in the Command Center right now.}
{4714}{}{Sorry, but I don't want to talk about this.}
{4715}{}{I think she is somewhere in the Living Quarters.}
{4716}{}{It's really a shame what happened to him!}
{4717}{}{I haven't seen him much lately. Maybe he is in his room over at the Living Quarters?}
{4718}{}{Oh, I don't talk much to her anymore.}
{4719}{}{We keep water reserves in the storage room now. A guard is making sure nobody steals any!}

{8306}{}{Gizmo runs it. Watch out for the slot machines, you can lose a lot of money if you play them.}
{8307}{}{Darkwater's? It's in the center of town. You can barter with him, or pay cash.}
{8308}{}{I dunno, but the name scares me.}
{8309}{}{If you're hurt, Doc Morbid can surely help you. His clinic is south of here.}
{8310}{}{Killian Darkwater runs the General Store. There you'll probably find what you need.}
{8311}{}{We've got some guards on patrol in the wastes. It's a dangerous place, but we manage.}
{8312}{}{Killian's store is right around the corner. If you're looking for a drink, the Skum Pitt is a to the north of here. There's also Gizmo's casino if you're looking for fun.}
{8313}{}{I'm happy it hasn't been raining like that in a while.}
{8314}{}{They'll hang you if you get caught stealing.}
{8315}{}{The City of the Dead, right? We've only heard some stories and rumors.}
{8316}{}{It's a place somewhere far south for all I know.}
{8317}{}{You know... Stuff.}
{8318}{}{That's our resident bar. The food's okay, but the beer's great.}
{8319}{}{Why do you ask? Do you want to cause trouble?}
{8320}{}{Luckily we don't run into much problems with them down here. Heard it's much worse up north.}
{8321}{}{If you need a place to sleep, check with the Crash House.}
{8322}{}{I sure could use one now.}
{8323}{}{Did you ever try our special meat jerky? Better than iguana for sure.}

{8900}{}{I have no idea what you are talking about.}
{8901}{}{A terribly low point in the human history which formed our present world. We preserve the knowledge from the War to prevent another holocaust.}
{8902}{}{A difficult and sorrowful decision. We lost a great many people who chose to go off on their own rather than traveling with the main force searching for a safe haven to live.}
{8903}{}{I don't know much about it. The reports I've hear is that they are amassing somewhere to the north of us.}
{8904}{}{That is where we stand.}
{8905}{}{Those Water Merchants are thieving bastards, but of the other groups, I have no opinion.}
{8906}{}{I don't know anything about that.}
{8907}{}{A slime pit for those vile merchants. Though, occasionally, we will let one of the more civil trading companies exchange goods with us.}
{8908}{}{They are a cult.}
{8909}{}{They are the future of the Brotherhood.}
{8910}{}{They are the keepers of the knowledge.}
{8911}{}{They are the ones who make the weapons for the Brotherhood.}
{8912}{}{They are the protectors of the Brotherhood.}
{8913}{}{I have no idea what you are talking about.}
{8914}{}{You'll find Dr. Lorri on level 2. If you need equipment, talk to }
{8915}{}{Lately, General Maxson is mostly in his room on level 4. Not sure what's going on with the other Elders.}
{8916}{}{Head Paladin Rhombus? You'll find him on level 1.}
{8917}{}{Oh, Vree is in the library on level 3.}
{8918}{}{If you're hurt, Dr. Lorry can help you. See her in the infirmary on level 2.}
{8919}{}{Every once in a while we're trading with a few outside merchants, but that's it.}
{8920}{}{We don't fear the outside world.}
{8921}{}{Dr. Lorri should be in the infirmary on level 2.}
{8922}{}{Our Powered Armor protects us from outside radiation.}
{8923}{}{Brothers have been expelled for lesser crimes.}
{8924}{}{Not everyone gets their hands on a suit of powered armor! Usually it involves indepth training, but I guess the Elders do make exceptions at times.}
{8925}{}{Talus is the second-in-command to Head Paladin Rhombus.}
{8926}{}{You know, where we store historical records and such? The library is on level 3. Vree should be somewhere around there, too.}
{8927}{}{He runs the supply room on level 1. If you need something, you'll have to get past him first.}
{8928}{}{I guess you'll find him in the workshop on level 3 running maintenance on some tech-project.}
{8929}{}{Do you see cattle pens around here?}

{18300}{}{We're the descendants of an old Vault that used to be under the south side of this city.}
{18301}{}{The Followers are a learned and peaceful people. They live in an old library north of here.}
{18302}{}{The Children worship a mysterious Dark God. They seem harmless, but there is something strange about their religion. The Cathedral is south of here.}
{18303}{}{The Rippers are all inbred. They have a fortified building with traps around it where they take prisoners to be tortured and killed.}
{18304}{}{The Blades are notorious for their vibro-knives. They are the arch-enemies of the Rippers. Their leader is a woman named Razor.}
{18305}{}{They used to be a gang, but they set up in a warehouse on the north side and started trading weapons and guns to people.}
{18306}{}{The Hub is a center of trade and commerce. They have companies that actually produce things. They're north of us.}
{18307}{}{Junktown is a moderate-sized city east of here and just north of the Hub.}
{18308}{}{Sorry, can't help you with that.}
{18309}{}{Tine runs the general store near the front gate. He can sell you weapons and traveling supplies.}
{18310}{}{Jon is our mayor. He makes trade agreements, dictates policy, and delegates responsibility to the Regulators and the scavs.}
{18311}{}{The city of the dead? It's supposedly a place inhabited by strange cannibals far to the east. I wouldn't visit there if I were you.}
{18312}{}{It's a big radioactive place far, far to the south, or so I'm told.}
{18313}{}{They're the police force of Adytum. They protect us from the gangs. Caleb is the leader.}
{18314}{}{The scavs have the job of searching the Boneyard for valuable equipment. They are led by Sammael.}
{18315}{}{The Angel's Boneyard is the remains of the old city of Los Angeles. We're in the middle of the Boneyard.}
{18316}{}{We had a doctor once. The Regulators had to take him down for stealing supplies.}
{18317}{}{Growing up in the Boneyard is tough. If the lack of food doesn't kill you, the drugs or the gangs probably will.}
{18318}{}{There's the Followers to the north, the Blades are hanging out east of here. If you make it through the old Cinema north of here, there's also the Gun Runners.}
{18319}{}{There sure is lots of crime in the Boneyard. The Regulators try their best to keep it all out of Adytum.}
{18320}{}{Merchant parties pay good money for protection around here, otherwise they'll lose their brahmin quickly.}
{18321}{}{It's where the Rippers had their hideout before something drove them away.}
{18322}{}{I've heard there's a nest of them somewhere to the east of the Blades, but I haven't seen it myself.}

{18901}{}{We are the Followers of the Apocalypse. It is our duty to bring peace and learning once again to the world, and to make sure that the weapons of war never again scar the earth.}
{18902}{}{The Cathedral is a great building south of the Boneyard. The Children are a cult worshipping a dark and evil god. They must be stopped before they spread their religion through violence.}
{18903}{}{Inbreds and jackals. They attack anything in sight that isn't related to them. They live west of here in a fortress surrounded by traps.}
{18904}{}{A singularly dangerous group living to the east, who fight with vibro-knives. Their leader, Razor, came from the Hub and molded them into a fierce family.}
{18905}{}{They are a gang living in a warehouse to the north, inside a moat of radioactive sludge. They sell guns to the other gangs.}

{18912}{}{It's a big radioactive place far, far to the south, or so I'm told.}
