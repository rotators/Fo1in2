{100}{}{You see: Trish, a waitress from the Skum Pitt.}
{101}{}{What the hell are you doing in my room?}
{102}{}{Gug!}
{103}{}{Whoops, sorry. I thought this was my room.}
{104}{}{Sorry. Bye.}
{105}{}{No way! I'm not into that! Go talk to Sinthia down the hall. She might be available, but she is never free.}
{106}{}{Yeah, right. Whatever. This is my room. Get the hell out.}
{107}{}{What the hell are you doing in my room?}
{108}{}{Grub!}
{109}{}{Whoops, sorry. I thought this was my room.}
{110}{}{Do you know a guy named Saul?}
{111}{}{I used to think so. Now, I'm not so sure.}
{112}{}{He really cares about you.}
{113}{}{I think you should dump him.}
{114}{}{So he says. If he did, he wouldn't be doing what he is doing.}
{115}{}{What's that?}
{116}{}{His boxing, right?}
{117}{}{You would say that. You want to take his place right?}
{118}{}{Nah. You're too skanky.}
{119}{}{Sure.}
{120}{}{Just leave me alone.}
{121}{}{Maybe you're right. Maybe I need to understand what he does and leave it at that.}
{122}{}{His fighting, of course. I don't get it.}
{123}{}{It's a man thing.}
{124}{}{Of course not, dearie.}
{125}{}{Of course it's his boxing. He's a really nice guy, but he needs to get out of it before it kills him.}
{126}{}{Maybe that's what he wants to do.}
{127}{}{Hey, I met you at the Skum Pitt. What the hell are you doing in my room?}
{128}{}{Plato}
{129}{}{I wanted to get a closer look at you.}
{130}{}{I wanted to get some info from you, and I didn't want to do it in front of that bartender.}
{131}{}{Just leave me the hell alone, you loser. Sinthia might be your kind of woman, but I sure as hell ain't.}
{132}{}{You should leave me alone. I really don't want to talk to you.}
{133}{}{Sorry to disturb you.}
{134}{}{Get out of my room!}
{135}{}{I'm gonna get Marcelles, and she'll clean your clock.}
{136}{}{My boyfriend could beat you up.}
{137}{}{Look, this is my room. Please leave.}
{138}{}{Thanks for helping out with Saul. He's really a neat guy.}
{139}{}{You got my boyfriend killed. I should hate you, but I knew it was going to happen sooner or later. Please leave me alone.}
{140}{}{Hey, thanks for helping me out when those Skulz jumped me. There aren't many people willing to do that sort of thing these days.}
{141}{}{Hnnn.}
{142}{}{You're welcome. See you around.}
{143}{}{You're welcome. Could I ask you a few questions?}
{144}{}{I guess so.}
{145}{}{Who owns the bar?}
{146}{}{Who is Gizmo?}
{147}{}{Why did you scream about Saul?}
{148}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{149}{}{Neal owns the bar. He's a good guy, always treated me right. We used to date, but he got a little too serious for my liking. I don't want to be a widow.}
{150}{}{Oh! Saul, where are you?!?}
{151}{}{Zzzz}
{152}{}{Sorry, we're closed. Come back later.}
{153}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{154}{}{Gizmo runs the Casino. He would like to take over Neal's bar, but Neal doesn't want to sell.}
{155}{}{ Killian and Gizmo do not like each other. One of them will either have to leave town or be buried beneath it.}
{156}{}{Welcome to the Skum Pitt. Can I get you something to drink?}
{157}{}{Yes, what do you have?}
{158}{}{Saul is my boyfriend. He's really good to me.}
{159}{}{Actually, can I ask you some questions?}
{160}{}{No, as a matter of fact, you can't. If you aren't going to order a drink, then you're in the wrong place.}
{161}{}{What would you like?}
{162}{}{Gizmo, well, Gizmo means to take over the bar. And if Neal won't sell, I bet some bad things will happen.}
{163}{}{One day, some punk is going to kill Neal for a glass of friggin' water or something stupid like that. In case you haven't noticed, running a bar is tough work these days.}
{164}{}{Nuka-Cola, 3 caps.}
{165}{}{Beer, 5 caps.}
{166}{}{The hard stuff, 20 caps.}
{167}{}{You see a waitress.}
{168}{}{Still, working for Gizmo is going to kill him.}
{169}{}{No, but you can't change him, and he can't change you. If you don't like what he does, then you should look elsewhere.}
{170}{}{Hnnngh! Hoo!}
{171}{}{Sorry, it looks like you're already a little gone.}
{172}{}{ experience for helping to defeat the Skulz in the bar fight.}
{173}{}{ experience for saving Saul and Trish's relationship.}
{174}{}{Here you go. Enjoy.}
