{100}{}{You see: Butch.}
{101}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{102}{}{Heard any good rumors?}
{103}{}{What else is around here, besides the Hub?}
{104}{}{What's in the Hub?}
{105}{}{Thanks, that's it.}
{106}{BUTCH01}{What do you want?}
{107}{}{I need to ask you a few questions.}
{108}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{109}{BUTCH02}{Time is money. Chit-chat is not money. You here about the job or what?}
{110}{}{Yes.}
{111}{}{What job?}
{112}{}{Here for the what or the money?}
{113}{BUTCH03}{Hot damn, someone with guts! Done and done. Go talk with my second, Rutger, and get the details.}
{114}{}{Wait! I have some questions about this job first!}
{115}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{116}{BUTCH04}{Ahh, don't spoil it! Make 'em quick.}
{117}{}{How much does it pay?}
{118}{}{Uh... what is the job?}
{119}{}{Well, if you feel that way, I'll just go talk to Rutger.}
{120}{BUTCH05}{Uh... Rutger'll handle that. He does all the trivial stuff for the Far Go Traders. Now get on out, 'cause I got work to do!}
{121}{}{One more question, okay?}
{122}{}{Okay, thanks.}
# Line 123 is prepended to 124.
{123}{BUTCH06}{Just one. }
{124}{}{ (You notice that he seems tense)}
{125}{}{Uh... what's the job?}
{126}{}{Is there a time limit on the job?}
{127}{}{Uh, how much does it pay again?}
{128}{}{Just how stupid are you?}
{129}{}{You seem tense. Want to talk about it?}
{130}{BUTCH07}{What's the... you agreed to a job without knowing what it is? Hot damn, you must be desperate. I like that!}
{131}{}{Just tell me what it is, okay?}
{132}{}{Well, you seem pretty desperate, too, so we're even.}
{133}{BUTCH08}{Well, some caravans have been disappearing on us lately. Damn if anyone can figure out what happened to 'em.}
{134}{}{So what do you want me to do?}
{135}{}{I bet you didn't even look for them.}
{136}{BUTCH09}{Simple. Find out who's doing it, and tell me. Or take 'em out. It makes no damn difference to me. Just get that job done!}
{137}{}{Any clues on who's doing this?}
{138}{}{I'll take them out.}
{139}{}{Sounds scary... I better pass.}
{140}{BUTCH10}{Nah. Just the normal stuff.}
{141}{}{Oh come on. There has to be something I can use.}
{142}{butch11}{Listen, I don't have time to swap stories with you.}
{143}{butch12}{Well there's uh... something, but I never listen to those rumors.}
{144}{}{Well, I do. What is it?}
{145}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{146}{BUTCH13}{You uh... you really want to hear it, huh? Well, some say it's the Deathclaw, but... but I don't know nothin' about that.}
{147}{}{You sound scared.}
{148}{}{Thanks. Can I ask you a few questions?}
{149}{}{How do I find out about the Deathclaw?}
{150}{butch13a}{How do ya... Go talk to Beth, she knows more about that crap.}
{151}{}{Yep, you're as scared as a whipped dog.}
{152}{}{I'll go check it out.}
{153}{}{I need some more information.}
{154}{BUTCH14}{Listen you, I ain't scared. I'm... cautious. You'd be stupid not to be, with the Deathclaw. Go talk to Beth, she'll tell ya more.}
{155}{}{You sound as scared as a whipped dog.}
{156}{}{Sorrrry. I'll go check it out.}
{157}{}{I need some more information.}
{158}{BUTCH15}{I'm tired of your insults, you... you pinhead! Don't come back! Rutger, take this annoying bug away!}
{159}{BUTCH16}{Done and done. Now get on outta here, but come back and talk to me when you've found something.}
{160}{BUTCH17}{Make it quick.}
{161}{BUTCH18}{Then what the hell am I doing still looking at you? Get out!}
{162}{butch19}{Uh... what did you say?}
{163}{}{I was implying that you were too frightened to go look for them.}
{164}{}{Nothing. So what do you want me to do?}
{165}{BUTCH20}{You know, I don't like you. But that doesn't matter. You want the job or not?}
{166}{}{Sure.}
{167}{}{No thanks.}
{168}{BUTCH19}{Uh... what did you say?}
{169}{}{You heard me.}
{170}{}{Nothing. So, what do you want me to do?}
{171}{BUTCH22}{Yeah, yesterday! Get going!}
{172}{BUTCH23}{Hmmm. Whatta ya want'a know?}
{173}{}{Just curious.}
{174}{}{No reason.}
{175}{}{Never mind. I have some more questions.}
{176}{BUTCH24}{Well, I've run the Far Go Traders for about five years. Before that I was in Adytum. Before that, near the Glow.}
{177}{}{Anything else?}
{178}{}{Well, thanks.}
{179}{BUTCH25}{Not really.}
{180}{BUTCH26}{Yeah, well I don't like going around talking about my personal life and such.}
{181}{}{Oh come on, please?}
{182}{}{Oh, all right.}
{183}{BUTCH27}{What do I look like, a... a... one of those tourist things? Jeez.}
{184}{}{No, you seem to be a brilliant man.}
{185}{}{I just want to know some general places.}
{186}{BUTCH28}{Thanks. Now, is there anything else?}
{187}{BUTCH29}{Well, you got Old Town and the Heights, but that's just houses. Downtown's got all the stores and stuff.}
{188}{}{What stores?}
{189}{}{Thanks.}
{190}{BUTCH30}{Just stuff. you wanta' see the town, go look around yourself!}
{191}{}{Uh, thanks for nothing.}
{192}{}{Thanks.}
{193}{BUTCH19}{Uh... what did you say?}
{194}{}{Are you deaf?}
{195}{}{Nothing. I need to ask you a few more questions, though.}
{196}{BUTCH32}{Well, you got the Maltese Falcon, a nice place to eat, believe you me. And then... let's see, the All-N-One Store, the Weapons Shop... and, of course, Bob's Iguana Bits.}
{197}{}{Thanks.}
{198}{}{Anything else?}
{199}{BUTCH33}{Got the Children of the Cathedral's hospital over on the west side of Downtown. And then, of course, you got the Water Merchants south, and the Crimson Caravan west.}
{200}{}{Thanks.}
{201}{BUTCH34}{Well, you got the Junktown to the north, and the Brotherhood of Steel to the northwest. And, of course, the Boneyard to the south.}
{202}{}{Anything else?}
{203}{}{Thanks.}
{204}{BUTCH35}{Well, Necropolis is east. But uh... I wouldn't spit there if it came out gold, if ya' get my drift. Those ghouls'll eat a man's face faster than an old lady shopping at bargain day.}
{205}{}{Sounds like fun.}
{206}{BUTCH35a}{Puhh. Maybe for you! If you like that, then the Glow's down south. It's a radioactive pit.}
{207}{}{Maybe I'll work on my tan.}
{208}{BUTCH36}{Just a bunch of different places. Go find out for yourself!}
{209}{}{Well, thanks for nothing.}
{210}{}{Thanks.}
{211}{BUTCH37}{Well, what do you have?}
{212}{}{Well, I found out who's taking the caravans.}
{213}{}{Well, I know it wasn't the Deathclaw who took the caravans.}
{214}{}{Nothing right now. Goodbye.}
{215}{BUTCH38}{Really? Who?}
{216}{}{It's these big mutant guys.}
{217}{}{Rats! BIG rats with BIG teeth...}
{218}{BUTCH39}{Wha... what would mutants want with our caravans?}
{219}{}{I don't know, but they seem to be taking the humans prisoner.}
{220}{}{I don't know for sure, but it's mutants, not the Deathclaw.}
{221}{BUTCH40}{What, do I look a crate shy of a load? Did you even see the Deathclaw?}
{222}{}{Been there, saw that, killed it.}
{223}{}{I'm telling you that it wasn't the Deathclaw.}
{224}{BUTCH41}{You... you killed it? Well... I uh... um... uh, where did these mutants come from?}
#
# TRANSLATIONS: lines 225 and 226 are no longer used, now is lines starting at 332
#
{225}{}{From the northwest. I think they have some kind of outpost there.}
{226}{}{Far to the northwest, from a fortified military oupost. They work for some loon called The Master. They aren't your regular mutants, either.}
#
{227}{BUTCH42}{An outpost? Well... um... well uh. I'll have to talk to the Committee. Yeah... yeah, they'll know what to do. Done and done. Get out, 'cause I got stuff to do... okay?}
{228}{BUTCH43}{The Master? H-He's more of a myth than the Deathclaw. You... you don't think he's real, do you?}
{229}{}{I'm not sure. But I intend to find out.}
{230}{}{Yep, I've seen him! And he's coming to get you!}
{231}{BUTCH44}{Yeah, done and... yeah, you do that! Uh, I need to talk to the Committee. They'll know what to do. N-N-Now get out! I've got a lot to do... okay?}
{232}{BUTCH45}{What?! Well... well... I'm not afraid! Rutger! I got guns! Rutger!}
{233}{BUTCH46}{Alright, so it wasn't the Deathclaw. But what would the mutants in Old Town want with our caravans? Unless it's some kind of conspiracy.}
{234}{}{No, no, no, you pinhead. These mutants are big and green and they have an army in the mountains to the north.}
{235}{}{You really are stupid, aren't you? You're not listening!}
{236}{BUTCH47}{What? Get out! I need to tell the Committee about this. Go on, get out!}
{237}{BUTCH48}{Come on. You can do better than that.}
{238}{}{No, really. They're these big, green mutant guys.}
{239}{}{You're right.}
{240}{}{Oh come on. You think a woman like me would lie?}
{241}{BUTCH49}{I don't have time for this. Get out, and don't come back until you find something useful!}
{242}{BUTCH50}{Well then, what is it?}
{243}{}{Actually, it IS these big mutant guys...}
{244}{}{Rats, I tell you! Big, hairy...}
{245}{BUTCH51}{Rats? You've got to be kidding me.}
{246}{}{No, really. BIG rats!}
{247}{}{You're right. I was just kidding.}
{248}{BUTCH52}{Well... okay. I'll tell the Committee, but I don't think they'll believe it. Although I have seen mighty big rats around...}
{249}{BUTCH53}{How do you know? Did you see the Deathclaw?}
{250}{}{Been there, saw that, killed it.}
{251}{}{Just trust me. I know.}
{252}{BUTCH54}{You... you killed it?}
{253}{}{Yep, sure did.}
{254}{BUTCH54a}{Well then, then who's stealing my caravans?}
{255}{}{I don't know yet, but I'll find out.}
{256}{}{Ralph did it.}
{257}{BUTCH55}{Uhh, do that. And come back and tell me... okay?}
{258}{BUTCH56}{Who the hell's Ralph?}
{259}{}{Never mind. I'll get more info on the caravan problem.}
{260}{}{He's coming for your soul!}
{261}{BUTCH57}{Hey! You're making fun of me, aren't you? Rutger, show this jerk the street! And don't come back without some real information!}
{262}{BUTCH58}{Yeah, right. Like I'd believe that. Get out until you can find me something useful.}
{263}{BUTCH59}{Well, whatta'ya got for me?}
{264}{}{It was mutants.}
{265}{}{Well, I know it wasn't the Deathclaw who took the caravans.}
{266}{BUTCH60}{Leave me alone! You got your reward, now get out!}
{267}{BUTCH61}{Hey, put that down!}
{268}{BUTCH62}{That's it. Rutger's gonna take it out of your hide!}
{269}{BUTCH63}{Stop that, right now!}
{270}{BUTCH64}{Well, what are you doing in here? Get out!}
{272}{butch65}{Oh... well, it's not, so get out!}
{273}{BUTCH66}{Rutger's going to turn you into a human pretzel. Have fun. RUTGER!}
{274}{BUTCH67}{Well, you're a bright one, ain't you? Here's the job: Find out who's stealing my caravans. Money, big. You fail, hurt, big. Understand? Now get outta here!}
{275}{BUTCH67a}{Wow, you're dumb. I don't have time for this. Go talk to Rutger.}
{276}{BUTCH68}{Go talk to Rutger. He can tell you more about that crap.}
{277}{BUTCH69}{Like I told you...}
{278}{BUTCH70a}{As I said...}
{279}{BUTCH71}{I ain't gonna repeat myself again!}
{280}{BUTCH72}{Listen, I ain't gonna say it again!}
{281}{BUTCH73}{He's the owner of the Maltese Falcon over on the west side. I'd stay clear of him; he's not honest, like me.}
{282}{BUTCH74}{Uh, no. Uh no, we don't talk about that.}
{283}{BUTCH75}{The Maltese Falcon is a nightclub on the west side. Hope sings there. What a doll.}
{284}{BUTCH76}{What a pain they are. We think their hideout's in Old Town, but we can't prove it.}
{285}{BUTCH77}{Oh, he's the sheriff. But if you see a crime, report to me. Justin doesn't rule the roost around here.}
{286}{BUTCH78}{Old Harold? What do you want with that old mutant? He's in Old Town. Just ask there.}
{287}{BUTCH79}{Those bastards. Daren Hightower thinks he owns the damn Hub, just because of the Water Tower.}
{288}{BUTCH80}{He heads the Water Merchants. Nasty, greedy bastard is what he is.}
{289}{BUTCH81}{You can find them over on the northwest edge of Downtown. They controlled the hospital before the Children moved in. Talk about trading the strange for the weird.}
{290}{BUTCH82}{He's the boss of the Crimson Caravan. If you ask me, he's nuts.}
{291}{BUTCH83}{Don't you know where your own feet are?}
{292}{BUTCH84}{That's me. You blind or something?}
{293}{BUTCH85}{Uh, Beth's the manager of the Weapon Store. She hears lots of rumors, if you're into that kind of stuff.}
{294}{BUTCH86}{Rutger's my assistant.}
{295}{BUTCH87}{It's south of the Merchant Market. The only source of water here and for a lot of the surrounding area. The Water Merchants own the damn thing.}
{296}{BUTCH88}{Three of my caravans have disappeared in the past month. At first I thought it was either the Water Merchants or the Crimson Caravan, but they've had disappearances too.}
{297}{BUTCH89}{It's where everybody trades. Smack dab middle of town.}
{298}{BUTCH90}{Uh, no I-I don't... Go talk to Beth, she knows more about that crap.}
{299}{BUTCH91}{The Glow is a radioactive pit way, way down south. Too much radiation for anyone to live there.}
{300}{BUTCH92}{Old Town's over on the east side. The skags hang out there.}
{301}{butch93}{It's over on the west side.}
{302}{BUTCH94}{Junktown? Yeah, I've been up north to that place a few times. Got some great booze.}
{303}{BUTCH95}{Junktown? It's up north. Heard they're having some trouble, what with their mayor Killian getting killed and all.}
{304}{BUTCH96}{He's the mayor of Junktown, that's all I know.}
{305}{BUTCH97}{I heard he's dead. What more do you need to know?}
{306}{BUTCH98}{Oh, they're a bunch of gun freaks up to the northwest. Really weird. They do make a damn fine weapon, though.}
{307}{BUTCH99}{He leads the Brotherhood. It's about all I know.}
{308}{BUTCH100}{Well, it's a big ruined city to the south. The Children, the Followers and Adytum are there, along with all the gangs and stuff.}
{309}{BUTCH101}{Why? What've you heard? I heard it'd been ransacked, but no one knows who did it. But uh, I'm not worried. No one can take the Hub.}
{310}{BUTCH102}{Well, it's the place where everyone goes to trade in the Boneyard. It's the only place civilized enough to do it.}
{311}{BUTCH103}{Last I heard, he's the mayor of Adytum.}
{312}{BUTCH104}{Well, they run a big, ol' hospital on the southwest side of Downtown. Bunch of religious nuts, if you ask me.}
{313}{BUTCH105}{He heads up the Children of the Cathedral down in the Boneyard.}
{314}{BUTCH105a}{Jain's the High Priestess of the Children of the Cathedral and sets up the hospital here in the Hub.}
{315}{BUTCH106}{I uh... heard stories, that's all. No truth to them.}
{316}{BUTCH107}{Best prices on the best guns in town. Everyone says so, it's not just that I own it! Just trot out this door and make a right. You can't miss it.}
{317}{BUTCH108}{Now there's some good eating. Bob's has got the best charred iguana this side of the desert.}
{318}{BUTCH109}{Well, you... uh... you don't want to go there. The prices are really high and the quality's bad.}
{319}{BUTCH110}{What do you want with them wackos? Jeez, all that peace preaching and tree hugging. Makes me sick.}
{320}{BUTCH111}{Don't know anything 'bout that.}
{321}{BUTCH112}{I... uh... don't think I want to tell you. Yeah, that's it.}
{322}{BUTCH113}{Never heard of it. You must have made it up or something.}
{323}{BUTCH114}{Well, last I heard it was trashed by someone. Don't know who, though.}
{324}{}{I'm busy right now. Talk to Rutger. He'll let me know if you're worth seeing.}
{325}{}{I've got nothing to say to you.}
{326}{}{Where do I get my reward?}
{327}{}{What was I supposed to do again?}
{328}{}{Get the hell out of here!}
{329}{}{Nothing yet.}
{330}{}{Snargle!!!}
{331}{}{Get out of here, you moron.}

{1118}{BUTCH91}{The Glow is a radioactive pit way, way down south. Too much radiation for anyone to live there.}
{1119}{BUTCH92}{Old Town's over on the east side. The skags hang out there.}
{1120}{BUTCH93}{It's over on the west side.}
{1121}{BUTCH94}{Junktown? Yeah, I've been up north to that place a few times. Got some great booze.}
{1122}{BUTCH96}{He's the mayor of Junktown, that's all I know.}
{1123}{BUTCH98}{Oh, they're a bunch of gun freaks up to the northwest. Really weird. They do make a damn fine weapon, though.}
{1124}{BUTCH99}{He leads the Brotherhood. It's about all I know.}
{1125}{BUTCH100}{Well, it's a big ruined city to the south. The Children, the Followers and Adytum are there, along with all the gangs and stuff.}
{1126}{BUTCH102}{Well, it's the place where everyone goes to trade in the Boneyard. It's the only place civilized enough to do it.}
{1127}{BUTCH103}{Last I heard, he's the mayor of Adytum.}
{1128}{BUTCH104}{Well, they run a big, ol' hospital on the southwest side of Downtown. Bunch of religious nuts, if you ask me.}
{1129}{BUTCH105}{He heads up the Children of the Cathedral down in the Boneyard.}
{1130}{BUTCH105a}{Jain's the High Priestess of the Children of the Cathedral and sets up the hospital here in the Hub.}
{1131}{BUTCH106}{I uh... heard stories, that's all. No truth to them.}
{1132}{BUTCH107}{Best prices on the best guns in town. Everyone says so, it's not just that I own it! Just trot out this door and make a right. You can't miss it.}
{1133}{BUTCH108}{Now there's some good eating. Bob's has got the best charred iguana this side of the desert.}
{1134}{BUTCH110}{What do you want with them wackos? Jeez, all that peace preaching and tree hugging. Makes me sick.}
{1135}{BUTCH87}{It's south of the Merchant Market. The only source of water here and for a lot of the surrounding area. The Water Merchants own the damn thing.}
{1136}{BUTCH98}{Oh, they're a bunch of gun freaks up to the northwest. Really weird. They do make a damn fine weapon, though.}
{1137}{BUTCH99}{He leads the Brotherhood. It's about all I know.}
{1138}{BUTCH109}{Well, you... uh... you don't want to go there. The prices are really high and the quality's bad.}
{1139}{BUTCH02}{Time is money. Chit-chat is not money. You here about the job or what?}
{1140}{BUTCH68}{Go talk to Rutger. He can tell you more about that crap.}
