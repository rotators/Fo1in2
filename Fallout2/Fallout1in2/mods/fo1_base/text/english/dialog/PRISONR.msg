{100}{}{You see a ghoul prisoner.}
{101}{}{Wha-what do you want.}
{102}{}{Uh, nothing.}
{103}{}{Hng.}
{104}{}{I'm here to let you out.}
{105}{}{What'd you expect.}
{106}{}{Hey, I don't care about that, just get me outta here!}
{107}{}{Great! Do it!}
{108}{}{I stole some water. Hey, I was thirsty! It wasn't like I hurt somebody.}
{109}{}{You took more than your rightful share.}
{110}{}{Ah, that's nothing. I'll get you out.}
{111}{}{I would've died without the water. It was only a cupful. Just enough to keep me alive. You gotta get me out of here! I'm going insane.}
{112}{}{Okay, hold on a moment.}
{113}{}{I think I'll let the authorities deal with you.}
{114}{}{Please let me go.}
{115}{}{Thanks for letting me out.}
{116}{}{No prob.}
{117}{}{Where does the water come from?}
{118}{}{Ya.}
{119}{}{They pump it up from the wells below. There is a manhole in the cell next door that leads to the old Vault. This is the source of the water. If it wasn't for those ones below, we would be a lot better off.}
{120}{}{What do you mean?}
{121}{}{Thanks.}
{122}{}{It's difficult to make the old tech work properly, sometimes. The glowing ones lash out whenever we go down there. Us ghouls just leave them alone. And the big mutants don't seem to care one bit.}
{123}{}{Good luck. Bye.}
{124}{}{You earn }
{125}{}{ experience for freeing the ghoul prisoner.}
{126}{}{Thanks again.}
