{100}{}{You see a Paladin.}
{101}{}{Pssst, see any good deals?}
{102}{}{Sorry, I'm on duty. Can't talk right now.}
{103}{}{What a nice day. I hope we don't have any attacks today.}
{104}{}{Good day.}
{105}{}{Some of these caravan traders are a little strange.}
{106}{}{Hi there good looking.}
{107}{}{Greetings Initiate.}
{108}{}{If you have any questions about our order you should talk to Cabbot over by the door.}
{109}{}{Cabbot is the one you want to talk to, he's the young lad by the door.}
{110}{}{If you're here to trade you're talking to the wrong person.}
{111}{}{What?}
{112}{}{Don't bother me worm.}
{113}{}{Do I look like I'm interested in anything you might have to offer?}
{114}{}{Hmph. The nerve.}
{115}{}{I'm on watch, don't disturb me.}
{116}{}{Initiate, you should know better than to bother us while we're on watch.}
{117}{}{Initiate, shouldn't you be doing something useful?}
{118}{}{If you have any questions about our order you should talk to Cabbot over by the door.}
{119}{}{I don't think you should be here stranger.}
