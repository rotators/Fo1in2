{100}{}{You see: Sammael, one of the scavs from Adytum.}
{101}{}{You see a grungy man in dark blue clothes.}
{102}{}{Hey, I don't believe we've met. You are?}
{103}{}{I'm }
{104}{}{.}
{105}{}{Who's asking?}
{106}{}{Eruh?}
{107}{}{The pleasure's mine. I'm called Sammael.}
{108}{}{What do you do here?}
{109}{}{Nice talking to you.}
{110}{}{Nobody special. Never mind.}
{111}{}{I'm a Scav - a scavenger. My job is to search out all of L.A. Boneyard for useful items and information. Dangerous work.}
{112}{}{Why is it dangerous?}
{113}{}{How do you avoid the Deathclaws?}
{114}{}{Have you scouted out any of the other areas?}
{115}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{116}{}{See you around. If you see me. Heh.}
{117}{}{Well, you got the Deathclaws out there, and then you got the Regulators back here in Adytum. Both ain't the most forgiving types.}
{118}{}{How do you avoid the Deathclaws?}
{119}{}{Have you scouted out any of the other areas?}
{120}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{121}{}{We only work at night, and we're good at what we do. But I'll admit not everyone always comes back. Last week I sent a guy up north to look for some parts for Miles, and we haven't heard from him since. The last transmission I got from him was that he'd found the parts, and was on his way back.}
{122}{}{I've done a little scouting. Who do you want to know about?}
{123}{}{The Blades.}
{124}{}{The Deathclaws.}
{125}{}{The Gun Runners.}
{126}{}{The Followers of the Apocalypse.}
{127}{}{The Children of the Cathedral.}
{128}{}{Nobody, thanks.}
{129}{}{The Blades are a pretty sorry sight for a group of people. They get by though, and some of them end up here in Adytum if they agree to what the Regulators offer them to do.}
{130}{}{Well if you haven't seen them before. They're mean as all hell, and like nothing more than to rip a poor scav's heart out.}
{131}{}{I've heard there's a nest of them somewhere to the east of the Blades, but I haven't seen it myself.}
{132}{}{The Gun Runners moved into a big factory up to the northeast not long ago. Can't tell you much because they have a moat filled with radioactive sludge, and you gotta get through the Deathclaws to get there.}
{133}{}{The Followers preach peace and tolerance. Nice idea, but impractical. They live in a big library to the northwest of us.}
{134}{}{The Children of the Cathedral are based out of a big church a ways to the south of here. There are some strange things going on there. I've seen creatures that can't be human coming in and out of there.}
{135}{}{And if the stories are right, the church is built over an old Vault, which Adytum's predecessors lived in.}
{136}{}{Heya. We see each other once more. What's up?}
{137}{}{What was your job, again?}
{138}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{139}{}{Oh, I see. Right. Bye!}

{140}{}{Miles said I should talk to you about parts for his hydroponic farms. Do you know anything about that?}
{141}{}{Ah, yes. As a matter of fact I do. Last week I sent a guy up north to look for the parts for Miles, but we haven't heard from him since. The last transmission I got from him was that he'd found the parts, and was on his way back. I haven't had time to check on it personally yet, and I don't want to lose another person to whatever may have caused his disappearance.}
{142}{}{Tough break, sorry to hear it. Thanks for the info. Bye.}
{143}{}{If I can get any info on your guy, is there some kind of finder's fee?}
{144}{}{Great, thank you. I'll search in that area for the parts. I'll let you know if I find your missing friend.}
{145}{}{Any time. Seeya.}
{146}{}{Would you? That'd be great. Like I said, things have been busy here and we can't afford to be losing more people.}
{147}{}{[laughs] No, not really. If I had the caps for that I'd already have hired someone to track him down. [thinks for a moment] I like your spirit, though. Tell you what, if you can find him, I'll see what I can do for you.}
{148}{}{Good news, I found your guy. Bad news, he's very dead.}
{149}{}{I'm sorry to tell you this, but it appears your friend was killed by the Deathclaws at the warehouse.}
{150}{}{Damn! [sighs] I figured as much. Thanks.}
{151}{}{Oh, that's right. Here's your reward. [He hands you what looks like a hand-held miniature chainsaw] There used to be a gang here that used these. Feel free to kill some of those bastard Deathclaws with it. See'ya 'round.}
{152}{}{Here, take this for the trouble, it's the least I can do. [He hands you 200 caps]}
