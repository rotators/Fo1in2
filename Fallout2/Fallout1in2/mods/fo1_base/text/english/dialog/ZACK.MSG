{100}{}{You see: Zack.}
{101}{}{You see a Gun Runner.}
{102}{}{Hi, I'm Zack. You want to buy weapons? Let me see what you have to trade.}
{103}{}{No.}
{104}{}{Okay.}
{105}{}{Can you give me a discount?}
{106}{}{You want to buy weapons? Let me see what you have to trade.}
{107}{}{Sorry to bother you.}
{108}{}{Nice doing business with you.}
{109}{}{}
{110}{}{Okay. Come back if you need anything.}
{111}{}{You'd better make up your mind fast. Are you here to buy equipment, or did you just come here to get shot?}
{112}{}{You have a real attitude problem.}
{113}{}{Sorry, maybe I could use some equipment after all.}
{114}{}{What the hell are you doing here then?}
{115}{}{Nothing.}
{116}{}{Sure.}
{117}{}{Yeah, well until Gabriel says so, you've gotta pay full price like everybody else.}
{118}{}{I don't know about that.}
{119}{}{Show me what you have anyway.}
{120}{}{Great! Show me what you got.}
{121}{}{I'll stop by later for that discount.}
{122}{}{Can I get a better discount?}
{123}{}{Sorry. I've given you the best discount I can.}

# Fo1in2
   {998}{}{Zack, your gear is top quality, but I am looking for something *even more* special.}
   {999}{}{Can we talk about the *even more* special gear again?}
   
{1000}{}{Sorry, but that's all I got right now.}
{1001}{}{Could try to get our hands on better materials again, now that the Deathclaws don't bother us anymore. It'll take a while, though.}
   {1010}{}{Anything you need help with?}
   
{1100}{}{Paying new scavs will cost. If you want to speed up the process, an investment of 10.000 caps would probably help.}
   {1110}{}{I don't have that kind of money.}
   {1120}{}{Really hope it'll be worth it, Zack! [Pay 10.000 caps]}
   {1130}{}{Uff. Maybe later.}

{1200}{}{Come back if you have that kind of money.}
{1300}{}{Can't promise anything. You have to check back from time to time, because this kind of inventory usually sells fast.}
{1400}{}{Okay.}

# Upgrade Weapons
	{1999}{}{Can you modify or upgrade weapons?}

{2000}{}{Sure as hell can. What do you have?}
{2001}{}{Sure as hell can, but you don't look like you have anything we can tinker with. Bring by some... eh, "normal" pistols and rifles, and we might be able to help you.}
	{2010}{}{Can you do anything with any of these pistols I have?}
	{2020}{}{One of my rifles could use some attachments.}
	{2025}{}{Can you beef up my flamethrower?}
	{2030}{}{Can you do anything with this cattleprod here?}
	{2040}{}{Nevermind. I was interested in something else...}
	{2050}{}{Actually, nothing today.}

{2100}{}{Let me see what you have.} # unused
	{2110}{}{Actually, could you upgrade one of my other weapons instead?}
	{2120}{}{Nevermind. I wanted something else...}
	{2130}{}{Actually, none of them. I have to go.}
	{2140}{}{Too rich for my blood. I'll be back when I have more cash.}

# Pistols
{2200}{}{We can put a speed loader on that magnum there for }
{2201}{}{That Desert Eagle you got... if you want, we can give it an expanded magazine for }
{2202}{}{ caps.}
	{2210}{}{Put the speed loader on the magnum.}

# Rifles
{2300}{}{We can put a scope on that hunting rifle for }
{2301}{}{That assault rifle you got there... We can give it an expanded magazine for }

	{2330}{}{Attach that low-light scope on the AK-198.}

# Melee
{2400}{}{You want that cattleprod juiced up? We can SUPERCHARGE it for }
{2410}{}{Sure.}

# Big Guns
{2500}{}{Let me take a look... Yeah, we can do something with it for }
{2510}{}{Cool.}

{2600}{}{Wait here.}
{2601}{}{There you go. Anything else?}
