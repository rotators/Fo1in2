{100}{}{You see: Jeremiah, a messenger for the Children.}
{101}{}{You see a Child. He looks pensive.}
{102}{}{Excuse me, brother. You startled me. How may I serve the Master?}
{103}{}{Quip!}
{104}{}{What are you doing?}
{105}{}{Ah, yes, a Super Mutant in training. I will return to my tasks.}
{106}{}{If you do not know, it is none of your concern. If you are inquiring about something you should not know, then I will have to report you to our supervisors. You should know better.}
{107}{}{I am a person of high importance.}
{108}{}{I'm sorry to have bothered you.}
{109}{}{I am new here.}
{110}{}{Who the hell are you to be asking me questions?! You're lucky I don't report you to the Holy Flame!!}
{111}{}{Transferring the reports, of course.}
{112}{}{Reports of what? If I may ask.}
{113}{}{And a mighty fine job you're doing.}
{114}{}{That is all. Thank you.}
{115}{}{Very well, then. Peace be with you.}
{116}{}{I apologize. How may I be of service?}
{117}{}{What is it you are doing?}
{118}{}{You can start by answering my question.}
{119}{}{You can die!}
{120}{}{Guards!!!}
{121}{}{It is obvious you do not belong here. Who are you?}
{122}{}{I am actually a vault-dweller and would like to speak to the Master.}
{123}{}{Um... Dorpheus... hmm... Morpheus sent me.}
{124}{}{I am Loki. An Initiate from the south.}
{125}{}{No, I don't belong here. But I know where this bullet belongs... in your head.}
{126}{}{I transfer the human purity reports for the surrounding areas. But you should know this. [looking suspicious] Who are you?}
{127}{}{I was sent here by Morpheus with a message for the Master.}
{128}{}{It is none of your business who I am... just answer my questions!}
{129}{}{You are not to know who I am, it is the wish of the Master.}
{130}{}{You dare question who I am? Fool, I should strike you down where you stand.}
{131}{}{That's rather odd... I've never heard of you.}
{132}{}{I was sent here by Morpheus with a message for the Master.}
{133}{}{I am of the High Order. Only the Master and Morpheus know of me in order to ensure my safety on the outside. But I have been called back by order of the Master.}
{134}{}{Please forgive me. I apologize for questioning you. Please carry on about your business, and if I can be of any service let me know.}
{135}{}{I do not know who you are, and you do not belong here. Guards!!!}
{136}{}{Who are you and what are you doing down here?}
{137}{}{I am a worshiper and I am lost.}
{138}{}{Morpheus sent me with a message for the Master.}
{139}{}{Looking for a lonely soul to send to heaven.}
{140}{}{Urk!}
{141}{}{You are not allowed in this area. Only Servitors and higher allowed down here. Return to the Cathedral proper.}
{142}{}{I apologize for any trouble I have caused.}
{143}{}{May I ask you some questions before I leave?}
{144}{}{Okay, but not before I split your head open.}
{145}{}{Morpheus would not send a slag like you on such a mission. Guards!!}
{146}{}{You idiot! You are not allowed in this area. Return to the Cathedral proper at once!}
{147}{}{Akay.}
{148}{}{Hunh.}
{149}{}{Nah.}
{150}{}{I transfer records for the Master. That is all you need to know, my child. Now, you must leave.}
{151}{}{I will leave now.}
{152}{}{I just wish to ask you a few more questions.}
{153}{}{I'll leave. I'll leave. But not until I blow your brains out.}
{154}{}{How did you get in here?! What are you doing sneaking around?}
{155}{}{I just wish to ask you a few questions.}
{156}{}{No, you may not ask me any questions. Now leave.}
{157}{}{Stop! You have no business being here!}
{158}{}{Duh?}
{159}{}{Sorry. I'm lost. I'll leave now.}
{160}{}{But I do have business here. Morpheus sent me on a mission for the Master.}
{161}{}{I followed a suspicious looking character down here. Have you seen him?}
{162}{}{No. Killing is my business and business is good.}
{163}{}{No, I have not seen anyone. What did he look like?}
{164}{}{Doesn't matter. I think he got away.}
{165}{}{It was a short little green man.}
{166}{}{He was about your height but was wearing a leather jacket... What do you have on under those robes?}
{167}{}{He looked just like you, shit-for-brains!}
{168}{}{Um... I... I... You don't actually think it's m... me? How ridiculous. I've never!}
{169}{}{Okay. I'll be leaving then, but let me know if you see anything...}
{170}{}{Yes! I do think it was you! Get down on the ground and spread 'em!}
{171}{}{No, I don't believe it was you but may I ask you some questions?}
{172}{}{Yes, my brother. How may I be of service?}
{173}{}{Yes, my sister. How may I be of service?}
{174}{}{What is it that you do here, brother?}
{175}{}{Just serve the Master. That's all I ask. Brother.}
{176}{}{Sorry, wrong guy. All you guys look the same in these robes.}
{177}{}{You can serve me by dying, you whacked out bastard!}
{178}{}{I transfer the human purity reports for the surrounding areas.}
{179}{}{That is all. Thank you.}
{180}{}{I would like to ask you a few more questions, brother.}
{181}{}{Yes, and a very important job it is. And do you understand the importance of your duties to the Master and all of us?}
{182}{}{Why, yes. I am the one who brings the Master the news of new, untainted humans untouched by radiation. I was the one who brought the Master the final news of a possible Lost Vault. It may still have pure-strain humans in it.}
{183}{}{Yes, my brother. You do understand. Thank you. That is all.}
{184}{}{I would like to ask you a few other questions.}
{185}{}{You wouldn't know a pure-strain human if he was standing right in front of you. Idiot.}
{186}{}{You wouldn't know a pure-strain human if she was standing right in front of you. Idiot.}
{187}{}{You act very strangely. I do not believe that you are who you say you are. Guards!}
{188}{}{You ask too many questions. I do not believe that you are who you say you are. Guards!}
{189}{}{Hey! I told you you're not allowed down here! Guards!}
{190}{}{You ask too many questions. Who are you?}
{192}{}{Excuse me, sister. You startled me. How may I serve the Master?}
