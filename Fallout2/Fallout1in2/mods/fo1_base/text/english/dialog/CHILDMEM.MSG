{100}{}{You see a devout Children of the Cathedral member.}
{101}{}{We offer healing of the body to heal the spirit. Can I help you?}
{102}{}{Yes. Help me.}
{103}{}{Who are you people?}
{104}{}{Uhn.}
{105}{}{That is fine, my child. We will examine you now.}
{106}{}{Blessed are the meek of mind. There is nothing wrong with you, my child. Run along and play.}
{107}{}{You have been healed. Be more careful in the future.}
{108}{}{You are wounded.}
{109}{}{You are not wounded. That is good.}
{110}{}{I see that you are poisoned.}
{111}{}{Hmm, some radiation poisoning. Unfortunately, we cannot cure that.}
{113}{}{We require a donation of }
{114}{}{ caps before we can heal you. Is this acceptable?}
{115}{}{Yes.}
{116}{}{No.}
{117}{}{But I don't have that kind of money!}
{118}{}{Will you take }
{119}{}{ caps?}
{120}{}{The Children do not haggle. Now, will you accept our price?}
{121}{}{Yes, of course I will.}
{122}{}{No thank you.}
{123}{}{Thank you, my son. Let us pray for your healing.}
{124}{}{Thank you, my daughter. Let us pray for your healing.}
{125}{}{There you go. Peace and blessings of the Children go with you.}
{126}{}{You do not have enough money. If you donate all you can, we will heal you. Is this acceptable?}
{127}{}{Yes.}
{128}{}{No.}
{129}{}{If you donate all you can, we will heal you. Is this acceptable?}
{130}{}{Yes.}
{131}{}{No.}
{132}{}{You have more than enough to make the donation. You need schooling in math, my child.}
{133}{}{We are the Children of the Cathedral. We live and work amongst those unfortunates living in the wasteland. If you ever get to L.A. Boneyard, stop by the Cathedral.}
{134}{}{Thank you.}
{135}{}{What do you do?}
{136}{}{We are the healers and teachers of peace. We heal the body to heal the spirit. All we ask is a small donation to pay for our healing supplies.}
{137}{}{Sounds like a good idea to me.}
{138}{}{Sounds like a load of crap, if you ask me.}
{139}{}{We did not ask you. I can tell you are tired of listening to our beliefs. If you need anything else, we will be here.}
{140}{}{It is the most holy of ideas. We are working toward ultimate peace in the wasteland. All creatures shall live as one.}
{141}{}{Thank you. Good day.}
{142}{}{We have no time to talk. We are leaving. This place is dangerous for us.}
{143}{}{Why are you doing this? We will do you no harm!}

{980}{}{I don't know anything about that.}
{981}{}{Sorry. No clue.}
{982}{}{Never heard of it.}

{1103}{}{L.A. Boneyard is a breeding ground of hatred. There are the Followers of the Apocalypse, the gangs: The Rippers, The Blades, and The Gun Runners, and a small settlement called Adytum. }
{1104}{}{They are people who seek to destroy the peace that the Master is trying to set forth.}
{1105}{}{I have no clue as to what you are talking about.}
{1106}{}{That is here. The sad remnants of an ancient world.}
{1107}{}{I believe he is one of the ghouls.}
{1108}{}{That is right over there to the northeast.}
{1109}{}{I don't know anything about that.}
{1110}{}{Of course. For a small donation we can help you.}
{1111}{}{We are all part of the Unity. It is the love and peace which we pass on to our fellow people, regardless of beeing human or mutant.}
{1112}{}{Maybe we can spare a few supplies.}
{1113}{}{Of course we will share ... for a small donation.}
{1114}{}{The ghouls sometimes talk about old times. However, I don't know anything about this.}
{1115}{}{If you really are a believer, the Holy Flame will guide you through the wastes into safety.}
{1116}{}{My child, there is nowhere else to go?}
{1117}{}{You should not think of such evil, my child.}
{1118}{}{The Holy Flame is the one who will lead us into a brave new world which doesn't have hatred or war.}
{1119}{}{The nuclear fallout. It brings death uppon all of us.}
{1120}{}{One of the gangs in the Boneyard. Last I heard, they were wiped out by something or someone.}
{1121}{}{It's a gang in the Boneyard.}
{1122}{}{One of the gangs in the Boneyard.}
{1123}{}{It's a small settlement in the Boneyard.}
