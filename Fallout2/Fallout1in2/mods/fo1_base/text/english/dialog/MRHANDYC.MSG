{100}{}{This robot is non-functional. The layer of dust on it suggests that it hasn't been active in a while.}
{101}{}{The robot is now powered on, but is still not functional.}
{102}{}{The hardware doesn't appear to be the problem; it must be a software issue.}
{103}{}{You cannot access the robot's functions, as it is disabled.}
{104}{}{You tinker with the malfunctioning components, but need more time to make the fix.}
{105}{}{You reboot the onboard computer, and successfully restart the robot. You notice that the robot's radio is broken.}
{106}{}{You spend some time working on the robot's computer, but cannot get it restarted.}
{107}{}{Unit #462 online. Self-test. Adjusting unit location data. Fixed. Rebuilding memory file. Fixed. Error - task incomplete.}
{108}{}{Rogga.}
{109}{}{What is your incomplete task?}
{110}{}{Well, just do it and get out of my way!}
{111}{}{[Click] Okey-dokey! Restarting task.}
{112}{}{Unit #462 is a cleaning model. Must finish cleaning and maintenance of this level.}
{113}{}{Go to it!}
{114}{}{What do you have left to clean?}
{115}{}{Vat Control Room. [Click] End of list.}
{116}{}{Heh, okay. Finish your task.}
{117}{}{You earn 1000 experience for doing a little clean-up work.}

# Fallout Fixt

{118}{}{That does nothing of interest.}
{119}{}{This Mr. Handy robot is in moderate condition, but appears fully functional.}
#
#  120 TRANSLATION NOTE: "Jury-rig" is a nautical term that's come into common use to mean "fix acceptably with the tools at hand" or "a temporary but functional workaround fix"
#
{120}{}{You jury-rig the robot's radio system; it should be usable now.}
{121}{}{You successfully replace the robot's radio.}
{122}{}{The interface systems are not responding to your input.}
{123}{}{The robot's radio is broken.}

{124}{}{Hold off on that for a moment. What functions can you perform?}
{125}{}{Unit #462 assists with duties as specified by memory files and programming.}
{126}{}{Yeah, yeah, skip to the interesting parts.}
{127}{}{Could you be more specific?}
{128}{}{[Click] Unit #462 can perform nuclear reactor fuel core replacements, hazardous materials cleanup, radiation cleansing, and basic mechanical repair procedures.}
{129}{}{Anything else?}
{130}{}{[Beep!] Unit #462 is also equipped with self-maintenance routines, self-defense mechanisms, and a fully customizable operating system.}
{131}{}{Self-defense mechanisms?}
{132}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{133}{}{[Click] Unit #462 is authorized to commit deadly force in preservation of itself, as permitted by prior programming.}
{134}{}{Deadly force?}
{135}{}{(A speaker crackles to life, and a recorded message of a male voice begins playing. It sounds like an advertisement.) "RobCo is committed to your safety and well-being. All RobCo Mister Handy units are equipped with state-of-the-art safety overrides, to prevent any unfortunate incidents. Rest assured, Mr. Handy is the best and safety investment your family will ever make." (The speaker shuts off.)}

{137}{}{[Click] Processing... [Click] Memory file data indicates that as of Unit #462's manufacture date, out of 4,628 recorded self-defense events initiated by similar Units, only 930 have resulted in deaths of unarmed civilians.}
{138}{}{Uh... That doesn't sound very good.}
{139}{}{Hmm. I could use some help cleaning up this place, if you get my drift. Could you help me out?}
{140}{}{Can the self-defense system be reprogrammed into a combat system?}
{141}{}{I think Vault-Dwellers would be considered civilians, so I'll do my best to not piss you off.}

{146}{}{Follow me and keep self-defense mechanisms active at all times. Oh, and don't shoot me, I'm not a threat. So you should probably add that to the self-defense protocols as well.}
