{100}{}{You see an intense young man.}
{101}{}{You see: Michael.}
{102}{}{Hello, I don't think I've seen you around here before. Can I help you with anything?}
{103}{}{Hi again, what can I do for you?}
{104}{}{Can you tell me a little bit about L.A. Boneyard?}
{105}{}{Who are you?}
{106}{}{Why do you all live here?}
{107}{}{Nothing, thanks.}
{108}{}{Sure. To the south is Adytum, over to the northeast you'll find the Gun Runners, but you'll have to get through the Deathclaws to get to them. To the west is the Followers of the Apocalypse, and to the far south I've heard there is some kind of church.}
{109}{}{I'm Michael. My wife, Christine, and I live here as Blades and help with what we can.}
{110}{}{It is not as bad as it seems. The Regulators and the Deathclaws can cause problems, but our leader, Razor, has helped us a great deal over the past months. And more recently, MacRae has been showing us how to protect ourselves better.}
{111}{}{Thank you for helping us clean out the Regulators from Adytum. Here is what we can spare to help you further on your travels.}
{112}{}{It wasn't a problem. Thanks for the supplies.}
{113}{}{You are welcome, and keep the supplies for yourself.}
{114}{}{I insist.}
{115}{}{(He hands you some stimpaks and some caps)}
{116}{}{Hello again. Good luck in your travels.}
