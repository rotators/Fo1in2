{100}{}{You see a ghoul guard.}
{101}{}{Go away! You're not wanted here.}
{102}{}{Okay. Nice meeting you, too.}
{103}{}{Huh?}
{104}{}{I'm on duty. If you want to see Set, you gotta do it inside.}
{105}{}{The door is locked. You'll have to come back later when it's dark.}
{106}{}{Thanks.}
{107}{}{Huh?}
{108}{}{I told you to leave. Your kind is not wanted here.}
{109}{}{Right.}
{110}{}{Myuh!}
{111}{}{The doors don't open until dark.}
{112}{}{I need to get in there. Is there any way you can help me?}
{113}{}{Hmm, okay.}
{114}{}{Ugh!}
{115}{}{Well, I guess it can't hurt. Go ahead, I'll unlock the door for you.}
{116}{}{I wish I could help you, but Set would tan my ass if I did. You know how it is... always gotta do what the big guy says.}
{117}{}{Yeah, I understand. Thanks.}
{118}{}{Thanks!}
{119}{}{You were warned. Prepare to die.}
{120}{}{The ghoul ignores you.}
