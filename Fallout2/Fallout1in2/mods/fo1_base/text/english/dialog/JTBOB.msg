{100}{}{You see the haggard shape of Bob.}
{101}{}{Please don't kill me! I swear I'll get you your money.!}
{102}{}{Duh-huh.}
{103}{}{Yeah, you'd better pay up.}
{104}{}{I think I have the wrong room.}
{105}{}{What are you talking about?}
{106}{}{Ack! You must be Dumb Fred, Merciless Killer of the Dirt. Please don't kill me!}
{107}{}{Here. Here. Take this. It's all I have.}
{108}{}{You mean you're not here to kill me?}
{109}{}{Nope. It's your lucky day.}
{110}{}{No. Who would be threatening you?}
{111}{}{Thanks. I just got a little nervous when you walked in here with a }
{112}{}{ in your hand.}
{113}{}{Thanks. I just got a little nervous when you walked in here with a }
{114}{}{ in your hand.}
{115}{}{Geez, I thought you were from the Casino. Sure as sand in the desert, I owe them a lot of money.}
{116}{}{Why do you owe them so much money?}
{117}{}{Who at the casino do you owe this money to?}
{118}{}{How much money do you owe?}
{119}{}{Hmmm. Thanks for the info.}
{120}{}{They cheat. I played a little slots and some poker. But I'm a better player than that. I swear those machines are rigged. I lost a lot of money.}
{121}{}{Who at the casino do you owe this money to?}
{122}{}{How much money do you owe?}
{123}{}{Hmmm. Thanks for the info.}
{124}{}{Some goons. They say they work for the Casino Boss, but I never saw him. One was called Izo, I think, and the other was some big Guido-looking guy. Damn cheaters.}
{125}{}{Why do you owe them so much money?}
{126}{}{How much money do you owe?}
{127}{}{Hmmm. Thanks for the info.}
{128}{}{Oh, not too much. A couple thousand. I only played for four or five hours. Well, maybe a little longer. They gave me some markers, and I don't have enough here to cover it. I gotta get back to the Hub and get some cash. I'm afraid they'll beat me up if I try to leave.}
{129}{}{Why do you owe them so much money?}
{130}{}{Who at the casino do you owe this money to?}
{131}{}{Hmmm. Thanks for the info.}
{132}{}{Oh, it's you again. I hope you did better than me.}
{133}{}{Hey, what are you doing in my room? Are you from the Casino?}
{134}{}{Nhhh!}
{135}{}{Yeah, I'm from the Casino.}
{136}{}{No, I'm just looking around.}
{137}{}{What's wrong with the Casino?}
{138}{}{Oh gosh. I thought you were from the Casino. You scared me.}
{139}{}{Oh, okay. Bye.}
{140}{}{Why?}
{141}{}{Well, I got into some trouble there. I owe them a lot of money.}
{142}{}{Why do you owe them so much money?}
{143}{}{Who at the casino do you owe this money to?}
{144}{}{How much money do you owe?}
{145}{}{Hmmm. Thanks for the info.}
{146}{}{Oh, it's you again. You scared me for a moment. You haven't seen anyone from the Casino around here, have you?}
{147}{}{Hnnn!}
{148}{}{No.}
{149}{}{Yep, sure did.}
{150}{}{Hey, I got some questions for you.}
{151}{}{Good, good. I just need a couple more days, and I'll make their money back and much more. I'm a better gambler than they think.}
{152}{}{Ack! Ohmygawd! I'm in trouble! Bye.}
{153}{}{Go ahead, shoot. Oh, bad choice of words, Bob. Bad choice of words.}
{154}{}{Why do you owe them so much money?}
{155}{}{Who at the casino do you owe this money to?}
{156}{}{How much money do you owe?}
{157}{}{Hmmm. Thanks for the info.}
