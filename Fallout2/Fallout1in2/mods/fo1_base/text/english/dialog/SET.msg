{100}{}{You see: Set, the self-proclaimed leader of Necropolis.}
{101}{Set00}{There'd better be a killer reason for standin' in my shadow. Does 'next on the menu' ring a bell for ya...  normie.}
{102}{}{Oh, killer it is, no doubt. Obviously I've found the head, uh, man.}
{103}{}{Whoa, what happened to your face?}
{104}{}{Wow, you're pretty smart for a ghoul.}
{105}{}{Nuh-uh?}
{106}{Set01}{Simple time. I'm Set. I'm in charge. Get it?}
{107}{}{According to my info you're just a second rate minion.}
{108}{}{Got it. }
{109}{}{Anything else I should know?}
{110}{Set01a}{Good.}
{111}{}{What can I do for you?}
{112}{Set02}{What is that? Sucking up? Listen, walker, I don't do the deal with norms, so blowing smoke up the tail ain't going to get you head seat at the table.}
{113}{}{The smoke will be coming out a lotta holes when I'm through.}
{114}{}{My apologies. I wanted to make a good impression.}
{115}{}{Didn't mean nothin'.}
{116}{Set03}{[Groan] I'm gonna to eat you up and be singing that 'Happy Tummy' song. I got that happy tummy... }
{117}{Set04}{Fact-time, bitch? I'm gonna enjoy squeezing you.}
{118}{}{Whatever's in your holster better be bigger than your mouth... Unlikely as that is.}
{119}{}{Squeeze this...}
{120}{}{Nuh-uh?}
{121}{Set05}{Well. I see some potential here... heh... I have playmates for you, my sparkling normie. Punish the mutants at the Watershed for me. Yeah, yeah, can do... yes?}
{122}{}{Uh, okay.}
{123}{}{Nuh-uh.}
{124}{Set06}{Excellent. Teach those mutants the last lesson, then amble back... Hmm. If I say to my ghouls to hold off you, the muties might hear and know. So I tell you what, it's favor-time. I keep shut. Got it?}
{125}{}{Got it.}
{126}{}{What about the ghouls?}
{127}{}{Duh, okay!}
{128}{}{Huh?}
{129}{Set07}{Avoid my ghouls, if you like your skin on. Any of mine that can't stop a normie deserve last rest. Get by as you need.}
{130}{Set08}{You eat my time! Cease to be, one way or the other!}
{131}{Set09}{You have no idea whose shadow you stomp.}
{132}{}{A second-rate minion. I know your boss. Not happy.}
{133}{}{Neither do you.}
{134}{}{Sorry, I have an odd sense of humor.}
{135}{Set10}{You walk for him? You're his sneak, straight? Here to skin me? Oh, I swear, you'll tombstone too.}
{136}{}{Whoa, Don't misinterpret. I'm not his. I'm here to help.}
{137}{}{Try it spaghetti face.}
{138}{Set10a}{It didn't sound it.}
{139}{}{I understand. He's my problem, too. Talk to me.}
{140}{Set11}{The Necropolis was mine. Not an all-things-great, but a straight-place for my kind. Then the Master showed. He could've fragged me good, but it was easy for him to just stand some muties and keep an eye on.}
{141}{}{What can I do, and what will you do for me?}
{142}{}{Sounds a bit out of my league. I'm outta this.}
{143}{Set12}{The mutants at the Watershed need dirt-naps. Makes my shadow grow. You slice 'em and rewards run to you. Info, too.}
{144}{}{Done.}
{145}{}{Too much trouble. See ya around.}
{146}{Set13}{You want employ, walker? Show me you can scuffle. Take down the mutants at the Watershed. Show 'em the bad time and you're good.}
{147}{}{I'm on it.}
{148}{}{No way, spaghetti face.}
{149}{Set14}{No. More questions? }
{150}{}{Ahhh, guess not. What can I do for you?}
{151}{}{Yeah. Do find it difficult to floss?}
{152}{Set15}{So funny my face hurts. Try again, and my Elites will juice you. Got it?}
{153}{}{Got it.}
{154}{}{I'm still a little unclear... }
{155}{}{Your face hurts alright.}
{156}{Set16}{My name's Set. Yours is World-A-Hurt. Take a deal, I change your handle. Listening?}
{157}{}{Sure. Beats bleeding all over your floor.}
{158}{}{Naww. Bring on the goons.}
{159}{}{Uh-huh.}
{160}{}{Nuh-uh!}
{161}{Set17}{Stride to the Watershed, dirt-nap the mutants there. Do it, you continue a walker. Don't, you rest.}
{162}{}{You sound a little scared by these guys, want to talk about it?}
{163}{}{I'm easy. Deal.}
{164}{}{You look funny, and you talk funny.}
{165}{Set18}{Well done. You've earned my sight, walker. Follow Garret for your reward. Now. I'm busy.}
{166}{}{Okay. Thanks.}
{167}{}{That's it? Thanks, now get out?}
{168}{}{Mom?}
{169}{Set19}{Look before you squeak. You'll enjoy. Be a shame to anger me, now... that I'm happy.}
{170}{}{I apologize for my outburst, but I'm a little concerned here.}
{171}{}{Sorry, no problem.}
{172}{}{Hey, I'm not settling for left-overs.}
{173}{Set20}{[Groan] Yeah, yeah. Follow Garret, and be showing your pearly whites too. And don't fret, I keep a straight-word. The Master runs the twist.}
{174}{}{The Master?}
{175}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{176}{Set21}{You don't watch your back, you'll wear his knife, he'll wear your skin. His mutants shadow the wasteland, especially south of here.}
{177}{}{If the Master is so strong, who can challenge him?}
{178}{}{He doesn't scare me.}
{179}{Set21a}{He should.}
{180}{Set22}{Children of the Cathedral, cids of the Hub, even us ghouls. No one can push his shadow now. But our light will be brighter next time. Ho-ho, yes.}
{181}{}{Good luck.}
{182}{Set23}{Follow Garret and get out.}
{183}{}{Right.}
{184}{}{Frag off.}
{185}{Set24}{You can be left-overs. Leave now, without your reward, or you're on the table tonight.}
{186}{}{If that's the way you want it.}
{187}{}{Frag off.}
{188}{Set25}{No word runs to my ear about the Watershed mutants ceasing to breathe. Major to my plans. Tell me it's a problem buried.}
{189}{}{Oh, yeah. No big deal, everything's been taken care of. Trust me.}
{190}{}{Nope, still working on it.}
{191}{}{Nuh-uh.}
{192}{Set26}{Ahhh, filling. Follow Garret to your reward. }
{193}{Set27}{You steal my time with your lies. Leave my shadow before... die. Die! Just die! }
{194}{Set28}{Walk now. Deal with the mutants, and then return. Not before.}
{195}{Set29}{Caught by mine, huh? I gave you the straight on them. Now you pay. No credit.}
{196}{Set30}{I am Set. Why do you tread my shadow?}
{197}{}{I am the bringer of death. Fall to your knees and beg for mercy.}
{198}{}{I am the bringer of death. Fall to your knees and beg for mercy... Or give me a sandwich, I'm pretty hungry.}
{199}{}{I'm here to see the boss. That you?}
{200}{}{Whoa, major case of acne!}
{201}{}{Uhh, ahdunno.}
{202}{Set31}{Normies. If you caused the trembles in me, would my gates be this open?}
{203}{}{I've killed ghouls. I've killed mutants. I've killed things that you couldn't even imagine. Nobody gets in my way.}
{204}{}{How about a face lift... It'll look good on my wall.}
{205}{Set32}{You topped those at the Watershed. I find that filling. For that, I'll give words. Then we walk opposite.}
{206}{}{Why don't we just 'walk opposite' now?}
{207}{}{Works for me.}
{208}{Set33}{A warn. The south makes a big dog whimper and tuck tail. If ideas dance in your skull, I make big dogs play dead. On the other, you clean-wiped the shed. Garret will walk you to gratitude.}
{209}{Set34}{Laughter comes hard here. You clean-wiped the shed?}
{210}{}{That's the fact.}
{211}{}{Oh, no. Wasn't me.}
{212}{Set35}{My wrong, your loss. Work grows, you should walk now.}
{213}{Set36}{Ah, yes. No tracks in the sand. Good. Filling. Walk with Garret to gratitude.}
{214}{Set38}{I cast the shadow. If that's the lot, remove yourself. }
{215}{}{I'm here to collect the bounty for some mutants.}
{216}{}{Thanks, I think I will be going.}
{217}{}{It'd be faster if I removed you.}
{218}{Set39}{Workable. Follow Garret to gratitude, then walk another path.}
{219}{Set40}{Reasons for aggressions? Walk and mine will stand. Talk and mine will move.}
{220}{}{Sorry, bad attempt at humor.}
{221}{}{'Bout time. Getting bored waiting for your face to clear up.}
{222}{Set41}{Ahh, the thinker-normie. You killed those at the shed, yes? Came for reward?}
{223}{}{Uh-huh}
{224}{}{Nuh-uh, me came kick ugly-butt.}
{225}{Set42a}{Now is bad. Walk. }
{226}{}{I deserve some information.}
{227}{}{How about I walk on your face?}
{228}{}{Got it.}
{229}{}{Nuh-uh?}
{230}{Set43}{Fine. Fast. What?}
{231}{}{You wouldn't do the mutants yourself. I ask myself why? Answer, someone has you scared. Why?}
{232}{}{Why'd you need me to kill the mutants? Why not use your ghouls?}
{233}{}{How in the hell can you call all this crap a reward?}
{234}{Set44}{I don't tremble. Use the tools of the time. You're used, you're rewarded, you're walking.}
{235}{}{You're bluffing.}
{236}{}{If you say so.}
{237}{}{I think that's a threat!}
{238}{Set45}{You don't even read the lines. Unless Necropolis is forever your home to be, walk. I have no time for a foolish blood-bag.}
{239}{}{How 'bout your own body-bag?}
{240}{}{Got it.}
{241}{}{Bite me.}
{242}{Set45a}{With pleasure... }
{243}{Set46}{No bluff, no twist. The Master does not tremble me. Walk. Your welcome has.}
{244}{}{Thanks for your time.}
{245}{}{Think smokin' you will bring back my welcome? Works for me.}
{246}{Set47}{Why send a ghoul for a child's work? Leave me.}
{247}{Set48}{I'm weary. You're gone.}
{248}{Set49}{Sow and weep! I want you dead! Dead!}
{249}{Set50}{I spy your twist and it causes one of us pain. Short-list choice: Remove the mutants or die.}
{250}{}{I'll get right to it.}
{251}{}{It's a bigger list. #3 is: What if I twist off your head instead?}
{252}{Set51}{Still in my shadow? Why do normie tongues waggle and take the movement from their bones? Clear-time, walk now.}
{253}{Set52}{Your presence means?}
{254}{}{Not much, just spreading the news that the Master is dead.}
{255}{}{Ran out of butt to kick and thought of your face.}
{256}{}{Huh. Master go boom.}
{257}{Set52a}{You mean dead?}
{258}{}{Uh-huh.}
{259}{Set53}{Warm. Filling. Your needs are my desires. Name them.}
{260}{}{Need some info on the Vats.}
{261}{}{I could use some more weapons and equipment.}
{262}{}{No thanks.}
{263}{}{Need stuff.}
{264}{}{Naww.}
{265}{Set54}{Some of mine slipped the bonds. Worked that mutant task.}
{266}{}{What did they say?}
{267}{}{Mutants, huh? I'll probably need more guns.}
{268}{Set55}{Big northwest, far from life. Busy with guards and tricky steering. If that's your path, walk it tight with my thoughts.}
{269}{Set56}{Garret will pass what's available.}
{270}{Set57}{You. Vanished our water processor chip. Exchanged it... for your life!}
{271}{}{We both need working chips. Apparently there is only one. Is there another method we haven't thought about?}
{272}{}{I needed the chip to save my own Vault. Sorry.}
{273}{}{Will sorry do?}
{274}{}{Want it back?}
{275}{}{Uhh?}
{276}{Set58}{A path, perhaps. An alternate pump exists, but not its actions. None of mine can breathe that life.}
{277}{}{Perhaps I should take a look at the pump.}
{278}{}{Too bad. Guess you're going thirsty.}
{279}{Set59}{Garret will walk you. Revive the pump, keep the chip.}
{280}{}{Thanks.}
{281}{Set60}{I'll drink from you warm, then take from you cold.}
{282}{}{I don't have it on me.}
{283}{}{How 'bout eating dirt instead.}
{284}{Set61}{Then die before mine!}
{285}{Set62}{Ideas will not matter to you again.}
{286}{}{I take it that's a 'no?'}
{287}{Set63}{Your price is to belong to Necropolis forever.}
{288}{}{Kind of expensive. How 'bout I remove you from office instead?}
{289}{}{Nuh-uh!}
{290}{Set64}{For the chip, you may walk.}
{291}{}{Gotcha! I don't have it anymore!}
{292}{}{Okay, here it is.}
{293}{}{I'd rather see you dead.}
{294}{Set65}{[Set passes the Water Chip to a ghoul, who runs off with it.] If your shadow touches Necropolis again, it will merge forever.}
{295}{Set200}{As said... }
{296}{Set201}{Stated before... }
{297}{Set202}{Don't do the deal with normies.}
{298}{Set203}{Natter to Garret. My time flies.}
{299}{Set204}{Is your head empty?}
{300}{Set205}{Yours is the only benefit. This exchange lacks.}
{301}{Set206}{Thoughts not in my possession.}
{302}{Set207}{The time is wrong. Evening is proper for your shadow.}
{303}{Set208}{Guards! Seize the norm!}
{304}{Set209}{Guards, end this annoyance!}
{305}{Set300}{His meaning has no place here. None.}
{306}{Set301}{The future. Survival anywhere. We surpass the norms.}
{307}{Set302}{An error of the world. A blot on my sight. I hate every facet.}
{308}{Set303}{Where your shadow lies. My home. My rule. A place where strength grows.}
{309}{Set304}{The beginning. World to ashes, ashes to growth. Our life.}
{310}{Set305}{Misguided ideals. Nothing to my sight, nothing at all.}
{311}{Set306}{Many of yours. Some useful, but too many twists.}
{312}{Set307}{Relics. We surpass, they don't know. Their sight is narrow, only what they believe.}
{313}{Set308}{Center of the Necropolis water supply. Poisoned by presence of mutants. Makes me empty to think on it.}
{314}{Set309}{Provides what is needed.}
{315}{Set310}{Beneath my thoughts.}
{316}{Set311}{Not in my thoughts.}
