{100}{}{You see: Razlo.}
{101}{}{I'm sorry but I can't help you.}
{102}{}{Can't or won't?}
{103}{}{Razlo looks at you for a moment, and then turns away.}
{104}{}{You look distraught. Are you in need of assistance?}
{105}{}{Tandi has been kidnapped.}
{106}{}{Hng, Tanny boo.}
{107}{}{Tandi is gone? That is a terrible thing. I hope they find her.}
{108}{}{Hmm, Tandi is gone? I find this hard to believe, but maybe she ran away with Seth. I know that they have been eyeing each other lately. Aradesh was always a little bit of a prude, perhaps it was too much for her finally.}
{109}{}{Hmm, I didn't think of that.}
{110}{}{I don't think so, I think that she was kidnapped.}
{111}{}{Perhaps, I'll go talk to some other people.}
{112}{}{How awful! If that is the case, I hope she is not hurt. Who is looking for her?}
{113}{}{Almost everyone.}
{114}{}{Many people, including myself.}
{115}{}{I hope she is found before it is too late.}
{116}{}{If she is hurt, it could be bad. Here, take these...  I hope that you won't need them.}
{117}{}{I hope Tandi gets back soon. Aradesh must be feeling terrible right now.}
{118}{}{I heard that you helped save Tandi. Congratulations and thank you. Any time you need healing, come here.}
{119}{}{My grief knows no end. Tandi, the only child of my good friend, is gone. I cannot work right now.}
{120}{}{I'm Razlo. Can I help you?}
{121}{}{Not right now, but it was nice meeting you.}
{122}{}{I need healing.}
{123}{}{Hnngh!}
{124}{}{Hmmm. I think I've seen brahmin with more brain cells than you. Well, let's see if you're wounded.}
{125}{}{Well, you seem fine to me. Perhaps later, then?}
{126}{}{Let's see here.}
{127}{}{I have already given you as much as I can. Good luck.}
{128}{}{Hmmm, I don't like your looks. I hope that you have come for business, and will be moving on shortly... }
{129}{}{No need to get defensive, I'm just looking around.}
{130}{}{Help, I need some healing.}
{131}{}{Hello, again. How can I be of service?}
{132}{}{Hello again. Just stopping by.}
{133}{}{I need healing.}
{134}{}{Ug!}
{135}{}{It was nice seeing you again. Have a good day.}
{136}{}{Of course. It's you again. Now what?}
{137}{}{Nothing.}
{138}{}{I need healing.}
{139}{}{Luki!}
{140}{}{Of course you do.}
{141}{}{Can I help you?}
{142}{}{No.}
{143}{}{I need healing.}
{144}{}{I've been poisoned!}
{145}{}{What do you know about radscorpions?}
{146}{}{I have a sample of the radscorpion poison, can you do something with it?}
{147}{}{Luki!}
{148}{}{Sorry, I can't cure any poisons. I don't have the proper ingredients to make a decent anti-venom.}
{149}{}{Here, let's see.}
{150}{}{Yes, just as I thought. Let me get the cure.}
{151}{}{You seem fine, now. Be careful in the future.}
{152}{}{Stop by again, but stay healthy next time.}
{153}{}{Not too much. They seem to be extremely large versions of the North American Emperor scorpion. Contrary to my medical knowledge, their poison has grown more potent, not diluted, as I would expect. Seth has been hunting them, which helps some of my tests.}
{154}{}{And how such a large creature can even be possible by natural evolution, or even radiation induced mutation is beyond me.}
{155}{}{Thanks.}
{156}{}{You seem well educated. What are you doing here?}
{157}{}{Anything else?}
{158}{}{They seem to be sensitive to light. Nocturnal. If I could get a sample of their poison, especially the venom production sac located in their tail, I could create an anti-venom.}
{159}{}{Thanks.}
{160}{}{Doc Morbid in Junktown taught me some. And just because we live in stone huts, does not mean we are less intelligent or educated. Have a nice day.}
{161}{}{Let me see the sac! Yes, I can do something with this.}
{162}{}{Here, take this as a free sample. It seems to work well against radscorpion stings, of course, but it shows much potential as a general anti-venom and poison cure.}
{163}{}{It's late. Come back in the morning.}
{164}{}{But I need your help.}
{165}{}{I'm trying to kill some radscorpions. Do you have anything to help?}
{166}{}{I'm looking for Tandi. Can you help?}
{167}{}{Hnn.}
{168}{}{Hnn?! What is that? Great, I get awakened by the great mumbling beast of the north. Come back in the morning.}
{169}{}{Are you hurt?}
{170}{}{Yes.}
{171}{}{No.}
{172}{}{You will be, if you keep me from my sleep. Now come back in the morning.}
{173}{}{Great Brahmin! Why didn't you say so?}
{174}{}{Uhhh. I did... }
{175}{}{You're barely hurt. I suggest a good nights sleep and some rest; you will heal naturally over time.}
{176}{}{You're barely hurt, you wimp. Come back in the morning.}
{177}{}{Ouch, that does look a little painful. That will be 25 caps.}
{178}{}{Okay, here you go.}
{179}{}{I don't have enough money.}
{180}{}{Oh Great Brahmin! That is very, very serious. It will cost 50 caps.}
{181}{}{Okay, here you go.}
{182}{}{I don't have enough money.}
{183}{}{How can you still be walking?! This looks extremely serious. We'll need some special prayers for this one and a lot of luck. Not to mention 100 caps.}
{184}{}{Okay, here you go.}
{185}{}{I don't have enough money.}
{186}{}{You don't have enough money! I'm sorry, but my work ethic doesn't permit me to heal for free, you know. Come back when you have enough money.}
{187}{}{Can you take something in trade?}
{188}{}{Thanks for nothing.}
{189}{}{Sorry, not today.}
{190}{}{Why would I be able to help you kill radscorpions? I'm a doctor, not a warrior. For that you should see Aradesh, or even Tandi, or her boyfriend, Seth. Leave me.}
{191}{}{I need something for their poison.}
{192}{}{If I had a sample of their poison, I could create a cure.}
{194}{}{I don't think so, I think that she was kidnapped.}
{195}{}{Perhaps, I'll go talk to some other people.}
{196}{}{This will take a little bit of time. Come, relax in the back. You might have a slight headache from the junja juice, as well. Come, come... }
{197}{}{I have already given you as much as I can. Good luck.}
{300}{}{ experience for helping to make an antidote for radscorpion venom.}
{301}{}{K, me giv?}
{302}{}{Nunga.}
{303}{}{Scorpin, Scorpin?}
{304}{}{My giv dis?}
{305}{}{How about a radscorpion tail instead?}
{306}{}{Let me see the sac! Yes, I can do something with this, as well as heal you for this great gift.}
{307}{}{This will take a little bit of time. Come, relax in the back, while I work with the sac. You might have a slight headache from the junja juice, as well. Come, come... }
{308}{}{Please do not take my things.}

{980}{}{I don't know anything about that.}
{981}{}{Sorry. No clue.}
{982}{}{Never heard of it.}

{1100}{}{They are a lawless group who pretend to be some people from the far past.}
{1101}{}{He leads the Khans. He is one of the most dangerous men that has ever set eyes on Shady Sands. He leads the raider clans with a heavy fist.}
{1102}{}{It's four to six days to the southwest. Good trading occasionally, but more often than not, they try to stiff us.}
{1103}{}{You're standing in it.}
{1104}{}{Much farther to the south than Junktown. The Hub is the largest city I've heard about. Must be a thousand people there, at least.}
{1105}{}{Sorry, I can't help you.}
{1106}{}{She is the daughter of Aradesh. Some day she could lead us, but she must learn to temper her ways.}
{1107}{}{He is the leader of our community, and a true hero. You can always find him at work in the communal hall.}
{1108}{}{He works with Aradesh to make sure we are safe.}
{1109}{}{That is me. I am the doctor for Shady Sands.}
{1110}{}{I might be able to help you.}
{1111}{}{Think one of the merchants is still in town. You should look for him on the east side.}
{1112}{}{Watch out for the rad scorpions if you're out there.}
{1113}{}{Well, there is not much. The guard house is right of the gate. You'll find Seth there. Our crop fields are on the east side. The brahmin pen is near there as well.}
{1114}{}{Seth and the guards are always on the lookout to protect our village.}
{1115}{}{Be careful of their tail. Their poison can be lethal if not looked after.}
{1116}{}{Truth told, they scare me more than the Khans.}
{1117}{}{Oh, we had more brahmin in the past, but we lost some to raider attacks on the plains just a few months ago.}
{1118}{}{Just a bit outside of our village. It's where we move the brahmin to graze.}
{1119}{}{You should talk to Aradesh if you haven't yet.}
{1120}{}{Ian is one of our guards. He was wounded when raiders attacked his caravan and is with us since.}
{1121}{}{Vault 15 is where most of us came from.}
