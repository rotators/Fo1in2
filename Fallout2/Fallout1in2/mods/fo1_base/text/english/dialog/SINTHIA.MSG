{100}{}{You see: Sinthia, the seductive sellbaby.}
{101}{}{You see a pouty, shapely woman.}
{102}{}{Hey, darlin, how you doin?}
{103}{}{Okay. Bye.}
{104}{}{Just fine, but I could be better.}
{105}{}{Uhh.}
{106}{}{Oh, baby, I understand. You gotta run home to momma. Well, come back here when you need some luvin'!}
{107}{}{Yeah, sweets, same to you.}
{108}{}{You'll find whatever, or whomever, you're lookin for, honey, and that'll make you all better, I'm sure.}
{109}{}{Maybe I can help you with that.}
{110}{}{Maybe you can. How much do you charge?}
{111}{}{I wouldn't let my dog touch you.}
{112}{}{Oh, baby, if you got to ask... more than you can afford. Maybe next time, sugar. See you around.}
{113}{}{Oh, sugar, that's just plain disgustin.}
{114}{}{Oh, gawd, please help me.}
{115}{}{Please don't let him kill me.}
{116}{}{I'm too young to die.}
{117}{}{Oh, gawd, I'm too pretty to die.}
{118}{}{Thank you for what you did. No one ever took care of me like that before.}
{119}{}{I can really take care of you later.}
{120}{}{You're welcome.}
{121}{}{Unh.}
{122}{}{Thanks again.}
{123}{}{Is that all you can think about? Geez. Some people.}
{124}{}{I mean, my boss didn't even send some of his goons to help. You'd think that for all the cash I make for that loser, he would at least live up to his part of the bargain.}
{125}{}{Who's your boss?}
{126}{}{What bargain?}
{127}{}{Gizmo, of course. He runs all the sin in this town. Killian sure as hell wouldn't put up with me or my kind. If it weren't for the fact that I make Giz a whole hell of a lot of money, I'd have to do other things to him.}
{128}{}{And, honey, those thoughts just don't do my stomach a whole lot of good.}
{129}{}{What else does Gizmo control?}
{130}{}{You should just hang it up and move on with your life.}
{131}{}{You're telling me. But what else can I do? It seems like my life has been designed by someone else. Oh, well. A girl has to make a living.}
{132}{}{But sugar, this one's for free.}
{133}{}{Thanks again, honey. We women gotta stick together.}
{134}{}{Just about every bad thing a person could do in this town. He owns the Casino. He runs me and some of the other gals, even some little kids. I hear he is trying to take over the bar.}
{135}{}{You stay away from him, okay? Take it from me, he is not the kind of patron he wants to make you think he is. Stay away.}
{136}{}{Giz wants to take care of Killian, if you get my meaning.}
{137}{}{Why, honey, I take care of men, and they take care of me in return. Gizmo gets 25% and I supposedly get his protection. You saw how well that went, huh?}
{138}{}{What else does Gizmo control?}
{139}{}{You feel like paying another visit to Sinthia.}
{140}{}{Maybe Sinthia would like some company...}
{141}{}{You bastard! I can't believe you killed him. All he wanted was someone to talk to. You don't care about human life, do you?}
{142}{}{You bitch! I can't believe you killed him. All he wanted was someone to talk to. You don't care about human life, do you?}
{143}{}{Just get the hell out of my room!}
{144}{}{You killed him! I can't believe you killed him. All he wanted was someone to talk to...}
{145}{}{He ain't dead. He's just gonna have a hurt head when he wakes up.}
{146}{}{Hnnn.}
{147}{}{Yeah, whatever. Get the hell out of my room!}
{148}{}{Oh, sorry. I though he was dead. I thought you killed him. He's not such a bad guy, after all. Just a little lonely.}
{149}{}{No problem.}
{150}{}{You again. What can I help you with this time?}
{151}{}{Just stopping by to see how you are doing.}
{152}{}{I've got 40 caps, if you got ten minutes.}
{153}{}{I need some more info on your boss.}
{154}{}{Ah, honey, I don't think so. Imagine how the children would turn out.}
{155}{}{Doin fine, thanks to you, sugar.}
{156}{}{What do you want to know, but make it short, honey, I'm on the clock.}
{157}{}{How many guards does he have?}
{158}{}{Where does he stash the money?}
{159}{}{Does he have any weaknesses?}
{160}{}{Thanks, doll, but I don't need to know anything else.}
{161}{}{Hmm. I know about eight, personally, if you get my meaning. I think he has another ten or so.}
{162}{}{Money? How would I know? He only takes my money, he doesn't show me his. I would guess that it's in his bedroom, but for all I know, he could keep it where the sun doesn't shine. And for Giz, that's a big place.}
{163}{}{Only that he thinks he doesn't have any. Well, that and he's a fat slob, who can't move for a damn. He's got to have his guards help him move around. Even then, they gotta use a little tricycle. Heh heh.}
{164}{}{Sugar, you got a date.}
{165}{}{Sure, honey, for you.}
{166}{}{I'll show you a good time.}
{167}{}{Honey, you need some more money. I like you and all, but a girl has to make a livin.}
{168}{}{I reserve the right to refuse admittance, and honey, you ain't gettin nowhere near me!}
{169}{}{Sinthia is asleep.}
{170}{}{Sinthia is busy.}
{171}{}{Sinthia refuses to speak with you.}
{172}{}{Sorry, honey, I don't do freaks.}
{173}{}{Take your cash, your attitude, and your small prick somewhere else!}
{174}{}{Oh, gawd, somebody help me!}
{175}{}{You earn }
{176}{}{ experience for successfully rescuing Sinthia.}
{177}{}{The guards remove the raider while he is unconscious.}
