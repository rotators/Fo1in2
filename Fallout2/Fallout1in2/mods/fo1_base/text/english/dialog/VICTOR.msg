{102}{}{Aaaaggghhh... }
{103}{}{New blood. Heh. Heh heh.}
{104}{}{Um, yeah. Uh, I think I'll go now.}
{105}{}{You're not a very happy person, are you?}
{106}{}{Huh huh!}
{107}{}{No, actually, I think I'll keep you around for a while.}
{108}{}{Why do you say that? I'm quite happy. I'm very happy because there are lots of things that bleed.}
{109}{}{You're a real sicko, you know that?}
{110}{}{Um, yeah. Bye.}
{111}{}{Ah, yes, art appreciation. Uh, I can understand that. I think.}
{112}{}{Don't say that! My mother said that! I'll make you pay! I'm a good boy, right mommy?}
{113}{}{Someone who understands me! At last!}
{114}{}{Hello again, my artistic friend.}
{115}{}{Ha! Ha! Heh heh hee! Ho ho ha!}
{116}{}{Zzzzz}
