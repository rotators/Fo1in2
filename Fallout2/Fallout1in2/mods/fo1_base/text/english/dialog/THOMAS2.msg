{100}{}{You see: Brother Thomas.}
{101}{}{Why, hello there. You must be the new Initiate Talus told me about. It's awfully late for a social call, what can I do for you?}
{102}{}{I need some supplies.}
{103}{}{I need training.}
{104}{}{I wanted some medical help.}
{105}{}{Nothing, sorry to bother you.}
{106}{}{Yuk Yuk?}
{107}{}{Ruh.}
{108}{}{What could you possibly want at this hour?}
{109}{}{I don't have time for this.}
{110}{}{What? Do I look like requisition man? If you don't even know who I am, why are you bothering me? Please leave!}
{111}{}{Damn it }
{112}{}{, I'm a trainer not a doctor. She's on level two.}
{113}{}{Well, why are you bothering me about it? Michael's probably asleep right now, unless Talus has him on sentry duty. Check at the supply room in the morning.}
{114}{}{Well, the Elders said no new Initiate training but...sure. You seem like a nice young lad. I'd hate for something to happen to you out there, when I might have been able to help. What are you looking to train in?}
{115}{}{Well, the Elders said no new Initiate training but...sure. You seem like a nice young lady. I'd hate for something to happen to you out there, when I might have been able to help. What are you looking to train in?}
{118}{}{Small guns.}
{119}{}{Big guns.}
{120}{}{Energy weapons.}
{121}{}{Unarmed combat.}
{122}{}{Melee weapons.}
{123}{}{Throwing.}
{124}{}{Nothing, sorry.}
{125}{}{Why I ought to throw you right out of my room, but I'm a nice old man. The Elders said no new Initiate training but...I might be able to help. They probably didn't have you in mind when they said that. What are you looking to train in?}
{126}{}{Why hello again. Nice to see you. Don't be shy, I don't sleep very much anymore. Are you looking for some more training? What shall it be today...I mean tonight.}
{127}{}{I knew you would be back! What're you in the mood for tonight?}
{128}{}{Are you going to ask me dumb questions again? I really don't have the time.}
{129}{}{Well, you see, different caliber weapons have...}
{130}{}{After a day of intense training you feel more skilled with small guns.}
{131}{}{The...}
{132}{}{After two days of intense training you feel more skilled with big guns.}
{134}{}{After a few days of intense training you feel more skilled with energy weapons.}
{135}{}{After a day of intense training you feel more skilled in unarmed combat.}
{136}{}{After two days of intense training you feel more skilled with melee weapons.}
{137}{}{After a day of intense training you feel more skilled at throwing objects.}
{138}{}{No problem. Let me know if you change your mind.}
{139}{}{I don't know why I'm wasting my time with you.}
{140}{}{Yes? Oh, I suppose you're looking for more training. Well, I don't sleep much anymore anyhow, why not. What shall it be?}
{141}{}{Now what? More stupid questions?}
{142}{}{Oh, that's all right. As I said, I hardly ever sleep. Come back any time.}
{143}{}{Well, stop pestering me then. I'm an old man and I need my beauty sleep.}
