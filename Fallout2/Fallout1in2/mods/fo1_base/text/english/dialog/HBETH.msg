# Beth is female. She speaks with a normal accent. She is a friendly person
# who is mostly interested in selling equipment and information.
{100}{}{You see: Beth, owner of the Weapon Shop.}
{101}{}{Hi there. How can I help you?}
{102}{}{Can I ask you some questions?}
{103}{}{Could I ask you some more questions?}
{104}{}{I want to buy something.}
{105}{}{I have something to sell.}
{106}{}{How does someone make money around here?}
{107}{}{Nothing. Bye.}
{108}{}{Ruk?}
{109}{}{What's the word out on the street about the missing caravans? }
# the Deathclaw is male
{110}{}{What do you know about the Deathclaw?}
{111}{}{Could you tell me about the Deathclaw again?}
# Decker is male
{112}{}{What can you tell me about Decker? }
{113}{}{What can you tell me about the different merchants?}
{114}{}{Have you heard any good rumors?}
{115}{}{Thanks, that's all. Bye.}
{116}{}{Umm, never mind.}
# Jain is a female religious figure
{117}{}{Well, I'm not one to gossip, but I heard that Decker's death is somehow related to the assassination hit on Jain.}
# The Maltese Falcon is a bar
{118}{}{Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but I know someone who knows someone that says that they saw three extremely large robed figures go into the Maltese Falcon right before the murders.}
# the Children of the Cathedral is an organization - religious
{119}{}{Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but someone killed Jain, the High Priestess of the Children of the Cathedral. I don't care for them myself, but I don't know what she could have done to deserve that.}
# The Brotherhood of Steel is an organization - religious
{121}{}{Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but a merchant friend of mine saw a group of mutants wandering around in the desert up past the Brotherhood of Steel, far to the northwest.}
{122}{}{Well, I usually don't talk behind people's backs, but the Children of the Cathedral have been asking people where you are. I'd be careful. They're a strange bunch.}
{123}{}{Well, I'm not one to gossip, but I heard that Decker's death is somehow related to the assassination hit on Jain.}
{124}{}{There is something else. I know someone who knows someone that says that they saw three extremely large robed figures go into the Maltese Falcon right before the murders.}
{125}{}{There is something else. Someone killed Jain, the High Priestess of the Children of the Cathedral. I don't care for them myself, but I don't know what she could have done to deserve that.}
{126}{}{There is something else. A merchant friend of mine saw a group of mutants wandering around in the desert up past the Brotherhood of Steel, far to the Northwest.}
{127}{}{There is something else. The Children of the Cathedral have been asking people where you are. I'd be careful. They're a strange bunch.}
{128}{}{Anything else?}
{129}{}{Thanks, can I as you another question?}
{130}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{131}{}{I'm sorry, what was that?}
# Klug and Ruk are a stupid person saying something incomprehensible
{132}{}{Klug?}
{133}{}{Ruk!}
{134}{}{I'm sorry, I don't understand. Please come back when you are feeling better.}
# The Merchant Market is a location
{135}{}{Well I'm not hiring but there's a job post in the center of the Merchant Market, you might want to check there.}
{136}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{137}{}{No, nothing good at least. Give me a chance to do some digging. [she winks at you] Anything else?}
{138}{}{Yes.}
{139}{}{No.}
{140}{}{What else can I do for you?}
{141}{}{Of course you can, don't be silly.}
{142}{}{Why sure, I'd be happy to help. What did you need to know?}
{143}{}{All right. Well it's been nice talking to you, have a nice day.}
{144}{}{No, that's all. Was there something else you wanted to talk about?}
{145}{}{Yes.}
{146}{}{No.}
{147}{}{Well come back soon. Don't be a stranger.}
{148}{}{Now there's someone you don't ever want to mess with, he scares me. He 'owns' the Maltese Falcon.}
{149}{}{Why did you say it like that? He 'owns' the Maltese Falcon.}
{150}{}{Why does he scare you? }
{151}{}{Sorry, it just reminds me of a friend that used to own it before him. Decker wanted it really bad, but my friend wouldn't sell. Two days later they found him dead in a back alley of Old Town.}
{152}{}{Why do you think Decker's responsible?}
{153}{}{Well he should have known better than to mess with Decker.}
{154}{}{Sorry, but I have to go.}
{155}{}{My friend was a clean freak. He wouldn't come within a hundred yards of Old Town. He was shot with a Magnum; no one in Old Town could afford one of those. Plus, he was shot once in the head and twice in the back. Does that sound like a robbery? My friend was just trying to get his life back.}
{156}{}{Hey, I like his style. After you kill him, put his body in the place he despises the most.}
{157}{}{Get his life back?}
{158}{}{I'm sorry to hear that.}
{159}{}{Oh, okay.}
{160}{}{You probably don't understand, but most of us look forward to the day when we own our own lives. When our lives don't belong to the merchants or the moneylenders.}
{161}{}{Oh, thanks.}
{162}{}{Don't you ever stop talking?!}
{163}{}{That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard!}
{164}{}{Is there anything else I can do for you?}
{165}{}{Well, excuse me. YOU asked.}
{166}{}{He's the deadliest person in the Hub; most say that he runs this place, not the merchants or the police. If you ever cross him, watch out.}
{167}{}{That gives him no right to kill anyone.}
{168}{}{You make me sick, please leave. I'm sure he's missing your company.}
{169}{}{Well, there are three main merchant groups. There's the Water Merchants, the Crimson Caravan, and the Far Go Traders. They also run the city council. What do you want to know about?}
{170}{}{The Water Merchants.}
{172}{}{The Crimson Caravan.}
{173}{}{The Far Go Traders.}
{174}{}{The City Council.}
{175}{}{That's all. Thanks for the information.}
{176}{}{Actually, never mind.}
{177}{}{They're in charge of all the water. Greedy people, I wouldn't want to work for them. Their pay is the worst and the jobs are just as bad.}
{178}{}{Did they always control all the water? }
{179}{}{Are they the ones behind the missing caravans?}
{180}{}{Thanks, another question about the merchants...}
{181}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{182}{}{What else would you like to know about?}
{183}{}{No. From what I've heard, a while back a group of merchants seized control of the Water Tower and proclaimed that they were the Water Merchants and people had to get water from them. The merchant war raged on for years until a man named Roy Greene - yeah, Justin's Grandfather, that's it - helped to negotiate an agreement that ended the war.}
{184}{}{What kind of agreement?}
{185}{}{Damn! Sorry I asked.}
{186}{}{Thanks, another question about the merchants...}
{187}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{188}{}{Well he set up the city council and set a limit on the price of water. Personally I think they should have beat the tar out of them - oh, sorry. I mean they should have showed them who's boss.}
{189}{}{Great. I didn't need quite that much information but thanks just the same.}
{190}{}{Thanks, another question about the merchants...}
{191}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{192}{}{Sorry I tend to get carried away with myself. Was there anything else you wanted to know about?}
{193}{}{The Crimson Caravan are a bunch of crazy people. They will do any job, no matter what the risk. I'm surprised they aren't missing more caravans than they are.}
{194}{}{They're missing caravans too?}
{195}{}{How risky?}
{196}{}{Thanks, another question about the merchants...}
{197}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{198}{}{They will pass right through an area known to be attacked by raiders. They charge a lot so they can hire extra hands. The pay's great but you have to be alive to spend it, right?}
{199}{}{They're missing caravans too?}
{200}{}{Thanks, another question about the merchants.}
{201}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{202}{}{Actually all the merchants have had a few caravans disappear. The Far Go Traders are just unlucky, I suppose.}
{203}{}{How risky?}
{204}{}{Thanks, another question about the merchants...}
{205}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{206}{}{The Far Go Traders pay well and their jobs aren't too deadly. Butch owns this shop, a good man. They're fair and let me do as I please with the place; I like working with them. Plus you get a discount on anything you buy here if you work for Butch.}
{207}{}{Personally I don't think so. I think it was the Deathclaw or maybe the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{208}{}{Why don't you think it's the Water Merchants?}
{209}{}{What exactly is a Deathclaw?}
{210}{}{Could you tell me about the Deathclaw again? }
{211}{}{Who are the Brotherhood?}
{212}{}{Why do you think it was the Brotherhood of Steel?}
{213}{}{Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.}
{214}{}{Okay, well I got to go.}
{215}{}{Some people think the Water Merchants are responsible, but I don't think so. I think it was that darn Deathclaw, or maybe the people over at the Brotherhood of Steel.}
{216}{}{Well, I thought that it was destroying the caravans, but I guess not. It's still out there though. There are too many rumors floating around for it not to exist.}
{217}{}{I think that's what's taking the caravans. It could also be the Brotherhood of Steel; they're a strange bunch. Some people think it's the Water Merchants, but they're wrong.}
{218}{}{Sure.}
{219}{}{Because, like I've been telling everyone, they've had a few caravans disappear too. Nothing like what's happening to the Far Go Traders, but they are being affected.}
{220}{}{They could be lying or it could be part of their plan to make you believe them.}
{221}{}{Why would it happen to the Far Go Traders more than the others? }
{222}{}{Another question about the missing caravans...}
{223}{}{Thanks, let's get back to the merchants. }
{224}{}{You're full of crap!}
{225}{}{Thanks, but I have to go.}
{226}{}{Excuse you! You're awfully quick to judge, are you afraid of the truth?}
{227}{}{There are six representatives two from each of the main merchant groups. Everything needs at least four votes to be passed. They can never agree on anything.}
{228}{}{Good thought, but I highly doubt it. They've been sabotaging each other for years, but this is not their style. They wouldn't spend that much money to take out the caravans. Plus all the caravans are very heavily guarded. You would think someone would escape. They don't have the man power or the cash to pull that off. There would have been at least one survivor.}
{229}{}{Yeah, but why would it happen to the Far Go Traders more than the others?}
{230}{}{Another question about the missing caravans...}
{231}{}{Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.}
{232}{}{Thanks, but I have to go. }
{233}{}{Bad luck? I don't know, maybe they're traveling along different routes than the others. Maybe because they aren't as heavily guarded as the Crimson Caravan but... they might have better cargo than the Water Merchants. Who knows? There doesn't seem to be any clear difference between the three.}
{234}{}{The Water Merchants could be lying or it could be part of their plan, to make you believe them. }
{235}{}{Another question about the missing caravans...}
{236}{}{Thanks, let's get back to the merchants. }
{237}{}{You NEVER stop talking do you!}
{238}{}{Thanks, but I have to go.}
{239}{}{Excuse me! You're free to leave at any time. If you didn't want the answer you shouldn't have asked.}
{240}{}{The Deathclaw is the most evil thing to rise out of the ashes after the War. Some say it's a powerful ghost from the war that haunts the land. It's no ghost, it's as real as you and me. It's 20 feet tall with teeth as big as your arm. It's some kind of demon that found its way here when the world was engulfed in fire.}
{241}{}{Uh, sorry I asked.}
{242}{}{You're crazy! I should just end your misery right here and now.}
{243}{}{Do you know anything else about the Deathclaw?}
{244}{}{Wow! Do you know where it is?}
{245}{}{Well, I know this old mutant in Old Town named Harold. He's seen it. He's the ONLY one that's seen it and lived.}
{246}{}{The only one that's seen it and lived?}
{247}{}{Yeah, sure, and I'm the Deathclaw's daddy}
{248}{}{Yeah, sure, and I'm the Deathclaw's mommy.}
{249}{}{Another question about the missing caravans...}
{250}{}{Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.}
{251}{}{I'll check it out. See ya.}
{252}{}{Uncle Slappy over in Old Town talks about it sometimes, but he's just a crazy old fool.}
{253}{}{Another question about the missing caravans...}
{254}{}{Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.}
{255}{}{Thanks. I'll check it out. Bye.}
{256}{}{You'll see!}
{257}{}{Yeah, pretty amazing isn't it. It's down to the southwest somewhere. There's an old mutant in Old Town named Harold who actually saw this thing in its lair. Nicest skag I know.}
{258}{}{Another question about the missing caravans...}
{259}{}{Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.}
{260}{}{Thanks. I'll check it out. Bye.}
{261}{}{The Brotherhood of Steel is full of crazy people that worship technology; they're to the northwest of here. They make human sacrifices and do all sorts of other terrible things.}
{262}{}{That's absurd! Who told you that?}
{263}{}{Another question about the missing caravans...}
{264}{}{Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.}
{265}{}{That's terrible, thanks for the warning. Bye.}
{266}{}{Well, um. I don't remember, but who ever it was wouldn't lie... I mean, it might be true! You should be careful just the same.}
{267}{}{Another question about the missing caravans...}
{268}{}{Well, let's get back to the merchants.}
{269}{}{You're an idiot!}
{270}{}{Look at the time, I've got to go! See ya.}
{271}{}{Why, you don't know? [whispering] I heard that they make human sacrifices and do all sorts of other terrible things!}
{272}{}{Yes, we do. What's wrong with that?}
{273}{}{As a MEMBER of the Brotherhood, I can ASSURE you that NOTHING like that is going on!}
{274}{}{Really? I've been there, they seemed strange but not that bad.}
{275}{}{Really? I had no idea.}
{276}{}{Like you don't know. You're obviously one of them, walking around in that metal suit. You're all a bunch of sick people.}
{277}{}{I don't know what you're getting at, but I can assure you nothing 'sick' is going on at the Brotherhood.}
{278}{}{Yeah, so. Aren't we all?}
{279}{}{I had no idea.}
{280}{}{Excuse me, sir. Please put your weapon down.}
{281}{}{Excuse me, ma'am. Please put your weapon down.}
{282}{}{I'm sorry but I won't help you unless you put your weapon away. This is a shop not an arena.}
{283}{}{Uhh... well, yeah... umm, you... I... Is there anything else you needed?}
{284}{}{You never know what a person's really like behind closed doors. You've got to be careful with who you associate yourself with. Was there anything else you needed?}
# Not believing the player for a moment, then getting nervous
{285}{}{You're a...? I mean. I didn't mean... Umm... Lovely day we're having. Don't you think so? So, was there anything else I can do for you?}
{286}{}{Another question about the missing caravans...}
{287}{}{Thanks, let's get back to the merchants.}
{288}{}{No, that's it. Bye.}
{289}{}{Sure, whatever you say. Was there anything else that I can do for you?}
{290}{}{Great! Let me show you what I've got.}
{291}{}{I've got the best goods, what are you looking for?}
{292}{}{That's what I like to hear! What do you need?}
{293}{}{Let's get down to business.}
{294}{}{If you've got money, you've got my attention.}
{295}{}{My favorite kind of customer!}
{296}{}{You want to buy something? Maybe I was wrong about you.}
{297}{}{Oh, that's right. You're working for Butch, you get the 15% discount.}
{298}{}{I'll still give you the 15% discount, because I like you.}
{299}{}{Sorry, you don't get a discount anymore.}
{300}{}{Show me what you've got.}
{301}{}{Do you have anything good?}
{302}{}{Well, let's see.}
{303}{}{Sure.}
{304}{}{What do you have for me today?}
{305}{}{That's great. I can always use more merchandise.}
{306}{}{I'd be happy to take a look at what you've got.}
{307}{}{Don't try to rip me off.}
{308}{}{I might let you sell me something, it better be good.}
{309}{}{You better not be wasting my time.}
{310}{}{I hope you have something I need, this time.}
{311}{}{Hello again. Nice to see you. How can I help you on this fine day?}
{312}{}{Why hello! It's nice to see you again. What can I do for you today?}
{313}{}{I wish I could get a day off, it's been so lovely out.}
{314}{}{Why hello again, aren't we looking handsome today?}
{315}{}{Back so soon? }
{316}{}{You just left. Miss me already?}
{317}{}{Need something already.}
{318}{}{Long time no see, what can I get you today?}
{319}{}{It's been a while, I hope you've been well.}
{320}{}{Still alive I see. I was starting to worry. What can I get you today?}
{321}{}{There you are. It's been more than a week since you last stopped in. You must stay in touch, you ARE my favorite customer!}
{322}{}{Yes?}
{323}{}{What?}
{324}{}{Are you hear to buy something or what?}
{325}{}{This is my shop, you better behave.}
{326}{}{What is it!}
{327}{}{You again?}
{328}{}{Time is money, what is it?}
{329}{}{Did you need something?}
{330}{}{Did you hear? He's dead! I'm overjoyed! That's the best thing that's ever happened to this city.}
{331}{}{I already told you. He's dead! Let's just forget about him, his name brings back bad memories.}
{332}{}{Oh, yeah.}
{333}{}{Yeah, he deserved it and I don't feel bad about doing it.}
# Sid works for Beth. Sid is male.
{334}{}{You did it? Really? I love you! [Beth looks over at Sid] Don't even think about it wise guy... Here, to show my gratitude... [Beth gives you six stimpaks.] It's not much, but I really appreciate it!}
{335}{}{You did it? Really? You're the best! You have no idea how happy I was to hear that he was dead. Here take these... [Beth gives you six stimpaks.] It's not much, but I really appreciate it!}
{336}{}{Sorry I don't have anything you like.}
{337}{}{Don't see anything you like? I'll try to get better goods.}
{338}{}{Sorry if you didn't like my offer, but I've got to be able to sell if for a profit.}
{339}{}{Don't want to sell after all? That's okay.}
{340}{}{Sorry I couldn't help you. Have a nice day.}
{341}{}{Maybe next time. Bye.}
{342}{}{Hope I can help you better next time.}
{343}{}{Stop wasting my time.}
{344}{}{If you're not going to buy anything, please leave.}
{345}{}{If you didn't want to buy something I wish you would leave me alone.}
{346}{}{If you're not selling, please leave.}
{347}{}{Don't bother me if you don't want to sell.}
{348}{}{Please leave.}
{349}{}{I knew you where going to waste my time again.}
{350}{}{Figures, I knew you didn't have any money.}
{351}{}{Thanks for all the business, maybe I'll go home early today.}
{352}{}{You almost cleaned me out!}
{353}{}{Hope you can carry all that!}
{354}{}{Thanks, I hope I can sell all this stuff!}
{356}{}{These should sell well, thank you.}
{357}{}{I can use these. Thanks.}
{358}{}{I hope I have room for all this!}
{359}{}{Well thanks a lot! I hope you have a wonderful day!}
{360}{}{Thanks for the business, please drop by any time.}
{361}{}{You're welcome here any time, during business hours that is.}
{362}{}{Thanks you and have a nice day.}
{363}{}{Bye! And thanks!}
{364}{}{That's it, just ammunition? I'm disappointed. Well, next time you'll need to spend more!}
{365}{}{Stocking up on ammunition? It's a good idea. You can never have enough.}
{366}{}{Just the essentials, right? Bye!}
{367}{}{Well, I didn't think you were actually going to buy anything.}
{368}{}{Thanks for the business, you're not so bad.}
{369}{}{Thanks for the goods.}
{370}{}{Have a nice day.}
{371}{}{Bye.}
{372}{}{Thank you.}
{373}{}{Thanks for the purchases, have a nice day.}
{374}{}{I heard that!}
{375}{}{No kidding.}
{376}{}{Sid! Stop that!}
{377}{}{I'll give you a gift if you don't shut up.}
{378}{}{I heard that! You're fired!}
{379}{}{Ignore him, I always do.}
{380}{}{Oh, you're just hilarious Sid.}
{381}{}{You wish.}
{382}{}{Shut up.}
{383}{}{Hey. Stay put Sid.}
{384}{}{I don't think so slick.}
{385}{}{I'll make you blue if you don't leave my customers alone.}
{386}{}{Please excuse my obnoxious- I mean, 'helpful' guard.}
{387}{}{You're such a knob!}
{388}{}{Sid!}
{389}{}{Honey? Where do you come up with these disturbing names?}
{390}{}{[Beth sighs] I}
{391}{}{ should lock him up. Don't you think?}
{392}{}{I think he's jealous!}
{393}{}{Sid! Don't be rude to the customers!}
{394}{}{Anyone else you know who might have some information about the Deathclaw?}
{395}{}{Goodbye.}
{396}{}{Thanks.}
{397}{}{Ook.}
{398}{}{Is there anyplace in town I should avoid?}
{399}{}{Oh yes. You ought to stay as far away from the Maltese Falcon as you possibly can. Decker and his greasy lapdog Kane are bad news. They'll eat you alive if you're not careful. I'd also give Lorenzo at the Friendly Lending Company a wide berth.}
