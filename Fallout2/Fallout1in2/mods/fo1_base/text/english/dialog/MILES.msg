{100}{}{You see: Miles, the chemist of Adytum.}
{101}{}{You see a thin man in a white smock.}
{102}{}{I don't believe we've met. I'm Miles. What can I do for you?}
{103}{}{I'm just looking around, thanks.}
{104}{}{That smock makes you look like a scientist. What are you studying?}
{105}{}{Huh?}
{106}{}{Well, enjoy your stay in our little town.}
{107}{}{I'm a chemist. Mostly, I make primer and powder so that we can re-use the brass casings from bullets. But I also dabble with some other chemicals.}
{108}{}{So you make bullets for Adytum.}
{109}{}{Where do you get the sulfur, potassium nitrate, and other chemicals?}
{110}{}{What other chemicals do you work with?}
{111}{}{Thanks for the information.}
{112}{}{Yes, although Smitty is the one who actually casts the bullets. I just refill the brass casings.}
{113}{}{But the Hub merchants make a profit off of you and the town.}
{114}{}{It's unusual to find someone who can appreciate chemistry! But to answer your question, some of the materials we get from Hub merchants; others I manufacture or just find in the area. For instance, the dung heaps from the brahmin are a good source, as well as some of the strains of fungus that I cultivate.}
{115}{}{Well, I've been trying to get some strong acids so that Smitty can use them for etching. I also have been trying to make some permanent dyes and inks. But without access to natural inks, it's difficult.}
{116}{}{Any time.}
{117}{}{Oh dear. I'm afraid I can't help you.}
{118}{}{Hello again. Can I help you?}
{119}{}{Yes, well, we have to make a living. Since the hydroponic farms aren't functioning, we have to buy food from the merchants, and bullets are the only thing we have to sell.}
{120}{}{I could try to get the parts to fix the hydroponic farms.}
{121}{}{Oh. Well, that's too bad.}
{122}{}{Really? That would be wonderful! We're just missing a few parts, but I'm sure that if you could scrounge up the right pieces, we could be self-sufficient! Sammael might be able to give you some help.}
{123}{}{Have you found the parts yet?}
{124}{}{Yes, here they are.}
{125}{}{Not yet, who did you say I should ask about them?}
{126}{}{You'll need to talk to Sammael. You'll usually find him in a tent down by the farms during the day.}
{127}{}{[Miles looks over the parts] Those are them, but it looks like Smitty is going to have to do a little work on them. Can you take them over to him?}
{128}{}{I've got other things to deal with. Can you do it yourself?}
{129}{}{Sure, I'll be back after he's fixed them.}
{130}{}{Sure, I appreciate you finding them for us.}
{131}{}{And... }
{132}{}{Not a problem.}
{133}{}{Oh. I almost forgot. Here is some stuff, for your trouble. [Miles hands you caps and stimpaks.]}
{134}{}{Were you able to take the parts over to Smitty?}
{135}{}{[Miles takes the fixed parts from you] Looks like Smitty did a great job on these. Thanks for the help, and here's some stuff for your trouble.}
{136}{}{[Miles hands you some caps and some stimpaks.]}
{137}{}{If you ever get back this way, you might want to look me and Smitty up. We might be able to help you out with some adjustments to some of your equipment. Smitty can work wonders with certain weapons, and I can help out with certain sorts of armor.}
{138}{}{Looks like you found some Power Armor. I've heard of a chemical process that I could use to harden the surface of the armor. However, I'm missing some information which could give me the last few clues to the formula and reagents necessary. I've heard the Librarian in the Hub, Mrs. Stapleton, has some journals and books that might be of use. If you could get those from there, I could probably test the process on your armor.}
{139}{}{Sounds good. I'll go talk to Mrs. Stapleton.}
{140}{}{I got better things to do than fetch something else for you.}
{141}{}{Well, if you ever change your mind, just go see Mrs. Stapleton and then head on back here.}
{142}{}{Had a chance to get to the Hub yet and visit Mrs. Stapleton?}
{143}{}{Yeah, here are the books.}
{144}{}{Not yet.}
{145}{}{[Miles takes the books from you, and starts flipping through them.] Hmmmm. Yes, hmmmm. [He mumbles to himself for a few more minutes.] Well, I think I can figure it out, but it will take a full day for the bonding to occur. Is that acceptable?}
{146}{}{Not a problem.}
{147}{}{Sorry, don't have the time.}
{148}{}{Well, when you have the time, come back and I'll do the process on your armor.}
{149}{}{[Miles takes your armor from you.]}
{150}{}{[Miles hands your armor back to you, it seems to glint a little more than it did before.] Well, I think it worked! Hope it helps you out.}
{151}{}{What happened to your Power Armor? I can only help you out if you have Power Armor.}
{152}{}{Nice to see you, but I'm right in the middle of some research.}
{153}{}{Nothing I can do with that type of armor. Sorry.}

# Fo1in2:
{154}{}{[Done]}
{155}{}{Can you produce improved flamer fuel?}

{2000}{}{I see you have another set of powered armor. Do you want me to take a look at it? 1.000 caps would cover my costs.}
	{2010}{}{Yes, please.}
	{2020}{}{I don't have that kind of money.}
	{2030}{}{No, thanks.}

{2100}{}{It will take a full day for the bonding to occur. Is that acceptable?}
	{2110}{}{Not a problem.}
	{2120}{}{Sorry, don't have the time.}

{2200}{}{Well, when you have the caps, come back and I'll do the process on your armor.}

# Upgrade Weapons
{3000}{}{Sure, could probably do that. With the chemicals I would need to create a super burn-mix, this would cost }
{3001}{}{ caps a batch.}
	{3010}{}{Sounds good. I'll take one for }
	{3011}{}{I'll take another batch of that super burn-mix for }
	{3020}{}{I'll take }
	{3021}{}{I'll take another }
	{3022}{}{ for }
	{3023}{}{ caps.}
	{3030}{}{Looks like I don't have the caps for that.}
	{3040}{}{I've changed my mind. I'll be back later.}

{4000}{}{[Miles takes the flamer fuel from you and begins the refining process.]}
{4001}{}{Here it is. You need anything else?}
	{4010}{}{That's all. Thanks.}

{4100}{}{I see. Well, get back to me once you have the caps and we'll talk again.}
