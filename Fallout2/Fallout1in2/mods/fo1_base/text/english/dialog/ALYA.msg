{100}{}{You see a desert raider. Judging by how the others look at her, she must have some position of importance or authority.}
{101}{}{I am Alya of the Khans. How might I help you today?}
{102}{}{I'm looking for a woman named Tandi. Have you seen her?}
{103}{}{How about a little kiss?}
{104}{}{Why has your band of raiders attacked Shady Sands?}
{105}{}{No, thank you.}
{106}{}{Hooroo!}
{107}{}{If she is one of those women from Shady Sands, maybe you should look there. Now go, I need to finish sharpening my knives.}
{108}{}{Kiss this!}
{109}{}{We do not attack those of Shady Sands. We are from the same place they are. It is only right that they share with us!}
{110}{}{But you are hurting their livestock and terrifying them.}
{111}{}{That seems fair to me.}
{112}{}{Uh, yeah. I think I'll be going now.}
{113}{}{You sound just as wimpy as they are. Look, if they were in any trouble of starvation, then it is their own fault for not planning ahead. Consider what we do a trade in talents.}
{114}{}{A trade in talents?!? How can this be a trade in talents? You don't give them anything.}
{115}{}{Sure, and chickens have three legs.}
{116}{}{Uh, yeah. I think I'll be going now.}
{117}{}{I am sorry, but I can't understand you. I'm sharpening my knives and would not like to be bothered.}
{118}{}{We give them the most important thing possible: We give their dreary lives excitement.}
{119}{}{I don't think they want your type of excitement.}
{120}{}{I think I will make their lives boring again. I'll start with you!}
{121}{}{Uh, yeah. I think I'll be going now.}
{122}{}{I didn't ask. But since you obviously don't have any concept of fun, I think I will end your existence.}
{123}{}{Mocking me does not bode well for you. I suggest you leave my presence.}
{124}{}{Damn straight it's fair. Now get out of my face.}
{125}{}{I am busy right now preparing for our next raid.}
