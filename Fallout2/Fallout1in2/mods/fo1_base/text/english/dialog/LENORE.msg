{101}{}{Oh, yeah, big man running from a scary dog. Phil, you sure showed it. Yep, you sure did.}
{102}{}{What are you doing, Phil? You're checking the tread on those sneakers, aren't you?}

{104}{}{That might be a little overkill for a poor defenseless animal, don'cha think?}
{105}{}{That sure is a nice pooch you have there.}
{106}{}{I'm sure Phil would appreciate it if you were to get rid of his dog.}
{107}{}{Thanks for dealing with that dog.}
{108}{}{You see: Lenore.}
