{100}{}{You see a farmer.}
{101}{}{Hi there, stranger. Like my crops?}
{102}{}{Good morning to you!}
{103}{}{Good afternoon!}
{104}{}{Evening, friend!}
{105}{}{Nice day, isn't it?}
{106}{}{This soil is much healthier than it looks.}
{107}{}{I'm trying to save these trees and I think it's working.}
{108}{}{There should be a fertilizer caravan. Now there's some money.}
{109}{}{Come on in, there's plenty of room.}
{110}{}{It's a little chilly out there; have a seat.}
{111}{}{Farming suits me.}
{112}{}{Did you know plants grow better when you're nice to them?}
{113}{}{I wish I had a little more land.}
{114}{}{Did you know there used to be large bodies of drinkable water?}
{115}{}{I've read about rivers. I sure wish I had one next to my fields.}
{116}{}{I wish the days were longer; there's so much to do.}
