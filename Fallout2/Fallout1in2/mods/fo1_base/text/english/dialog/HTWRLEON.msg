{100}{}{You see: Leon, a guard.}
{101}{}{What is your business here?}
{102}{}{I must speak with Mr. Hightower.}
{103}{}{I've come to kill Mr. Hightower.}
{104}{}{What business is it of yours?}
{105}{}{Okay. But I'm watching you. He's in his office.}
{106}{}{Thank you.}
{107}{}{Yeah... I bet you're watching me.}
{108}{}{I don't like your attitude. I'm going to have to ask you to leave.}
{109}{}{I'll leave when I'm good and ready, pal!}
{110}{}{Okay, I'll leave.}
{111}{}{Attitude? I'll show you attitude!!!}
{112}{}{Whatever it is, you can tell me. Mr. H is busy right now.}
{113}{}{Why do you have to be so difficult?}
{114}{}{I would much rather tell him in person. It's a matter of life and death.}
{115}{}{Decker has put a contract out on Hightower's life.}
{116}{}{You can tell me, or you can leave.}
{117}{}{Who died and made you God?}
{118}{}{Decker has put a contract out on Hightower's life.}
{119}{}{Look, I'm not tellin' you a damn thing!}
{120}{}{I'll leave.}
{121}{}{Again? What a fool Decker is. Well... I guess he's not as big a fool as the guys he hires for these jobs. See here, check out my gun.}
{122}{}{[Leon shows you the side of his gun where 5 deep scratch marks are visible.]}
{123}{}{Each one of these marks is for a past attempt on Hightower's life. I bagged each and every one of them. Tell me... do you know what this fool Decker hired looks like?}
{124}{}{No.}
{125}{}{It's me, you idiot!}
{126}{}{Hey! Wow! You've got scratch marks on your gun! You're coooooool!}
{127}{}{Thank you for the advance warning, but Mr. Hightower doesn't like strangers hangin' around. I'm going to have to ask you to leave.}
{128}{}{That's it? No reward? What the hell is wrong with you people?}
{129}{}{You're welcome. Goodbye.}
{130}{}{Mr. Hightower is not taking any visitors. Now leave!}
{131}{}{I'll leave when I'm good and ready, pal!}
{132}{}{Okay, I'll leave.}
{133}{}{I really need to speak to Mr. Hightower.}
{134}{}{Okay, buddy. Let's go. [Leon grabs you by the arm.]}
{135}{}{Get your damn hands off me!}
{136}{}{All right, all right! I'm going.}
{137}{}{Wait! I'm not finished!}
{138}{}{Ug!}
{139}{}{Rookl!}
{140}{}{I have urgent news for Mr. Hightower.}
{141}{}{What are you doing here? I'm off duty now. Go bother someone else.}
{142}{}{I was hoping your sorry hide would wander around here sometime! Guards!}
