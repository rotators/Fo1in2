{100}{}{You see a thug.}
{101}{}{Hey, aren't you the bastard who's been screwing us over? Man, did you come to the wrong place!}
{102}{}{Hey aren't you the bitch who's been screwing us over? You're in the wrong place, lady, and it's gonna cost you!}
{103}{}{I'm on your side now. So get outta my way!}
{104}{}{You're mistaken. Everyone looks the same out in the Wastes.}
{105}{}{Wrong place? Looks right to me!}
{106}{}{You wanna start something, I'll make sure you go down before I try something. C'mon punk, start it up! Let's see some balls!}
{107}{}{Wrong place? I not lost!}
{108}{}{Yeah. What do you want?}
{109}{}{Man, I just want to speak with a real human being. These zombies are giving me the creeps.}
{110}{}{Brother, will you not praise the Master with me?}
{111}{}{Hey, just looking for a friendly face.}
{112}{}{I want to see the Master.}
{113}{}{To see a valley filled with my enemies' heads mounted on spears. A silent valley, except for the wind whistling through their ears.}
{114}{}{Food! Me want food!}
{115}{}{Hey, haven't I heard about you? You've killed all sorts of shit, haven't you? What brings you here?}
{116}{}{I heard about some strange stuff happening here. What's going on?}
{117}{}{Peace, unity, that sort of stuff.}
{118}{}{Where's the Master?}
{119}{}{Just looking for a friend. Someone to talk with.}
{120}{}{I heard the booze is pretty good around here.}
{121}{}{My feet.}
{122}{}{You wanna talk, you better get that weapon outta my face! Lower it now!}
{123}{}{It's a force of habit. You drop the attitude and I'll lower the weapon.}
{124}{}{I'm not dead yet, so I'm not lowering it.}
{125}{}{What's the problem? I just want to talk.}
{126}{}{I'm on guard duty.}
{127}{}{What you say?}
{128}{}{You got something to say, say it fast.}
{129}{}{What's going on around here?}
{130}{}{I want to speak with the Master.}
{131}{}{I want to speak with whomever's in charge here.}
{132}{}{It! It-it-it-it-it-it-it!}
{133}{}{A ton of shit. Peace. Unity. Love. Lots of idiots running around like zombies. Morpheus counting his bottle caps upstairs. Lasher living up to his name. You want a piece of this, you're welcome to it?}
{134}{}{I've heard that you're doing a lot of stuff that isn't exactly peace and love.}
{135}{}{What's going on with Morpheus?}
{136}{}{Who's this Lasher character?}
{137}{}{Fine. What do you want?}
{138}{}{Have you noticed any unusual happenings around here?}
{139}{}{What's going on around here?}
{140}{}{Where's the Master?}
{141}{}{Just looking for a friend.}
{142}{}{To finish what the nuke started.}
{143}{}{Man, stay away from him! He's completely... I dunno if I can really describe him. Imagine the one person on Earth you don't wanna know. Lasher's worse.}
{144}{}{Does he and Morpheus get along?}
{145}{}{So what's he done? What makes him so bad?}
{146}{}{You ain't met me yet pal.}
{147}{}{Talk to Morpheus, and hope he doesn't kill you for asking.}
{148}{}{I don't think he'll want to do that. I have important information.}
{149}{}{Why would he want to do that?}
{150}{}{What's this about Morpheus?}
{151}{}{Well, this world is 'kill or be killed', and I'm still here!}
{152}{}{Yeah, what sort of information?}
{153}{}{There's a spy here. I need to see the person in charge at once.}
{154}{}{I could tell you, but I'd have to kill you.}
{155}{}{Uh... well... I can't talk about it.}
{156}{}{Somebody in the Cathedral's gonna die soon. Maybe lots of people.}
{157}{}{Fine. I don't really care who you are. Now get out of my face!}
{158}{}{Everybody! Take this asshole out now!}
{159}{}{Mister, you're nuts! Why don't you get outta here?}
{160}{}{Lady, you're nuts! Why don't you get outta here?}
{161}{}{Because I'm having such a good time. What's you're problem? I haven't disemboweled you - yet - where's your guts?}
{162}{}{Because I haven't killed you yet!}
{163}{}{Yeah, I really want your company. Like I enjoyed it last time! Get lost!}
{164}{}{Hi there. Nice weapon you got. Now try lowering it.}
{165}{}{It's a force of habit. You drop the attitude and I'll lower the weapon.}
{166}{}{I ain't dead yet, so I ain't lowering it.}
{167}{}{What's the problem? I just want to talk.}
{168}{}{I'm on guard duty.}
{169}{}{Thanks for the complement. Dork.}
{170}{}{What you say?}
{171}{}{Fine. What do you want?}
{172}{}{Have you noticed any unusual happenings around here?}
{173}{}{What's going on around here?}
{174}{}{Where's the Master?}
{175}{}{Just looking for a friend.}
{176}{}{To see your head drop off your shoulders, so I can kick it around this room like a soccer ball until your skull has been completely smashed to pieces!}
{177}{}{If you weren't wearing those robes, I'd kill you. As it stands, I want to kill you. Get away from me. Now.}
{178}{}{You aren't Nightkin. Guards! We have a spy...}
{179}{}{Where the hell did they dig you up? And why don't you just go back to where you came from? Get out of here!}
{180}{}{We're getting ready for war! We're going to save the world! So we can fill it with all of this Peace and Unity bullshit.}
{181}{}{War? Where's the first move?}
{182}{}{Bullshit? Tell me you're joking! It must be true! [wink]}
{183}{}{Bullshit? Tell me you're joking! It must be true! [straight faced]}
{184}{}{If it's bullshit, why are you here?}
{185}{}{Just as long as I get a chance to kill something.}
{186}{}{I don't know! The only person who's seen him is Morpheus, and he's up in his tower. Man, you're creeping me!}
{187}{}{I have that effect sometimes. You keep cooperating, and you'll have no reason to be afraid.}
{188}{}{Tell me more about Morpheus!}
{189}{}{Who else is important in this joint?}
{190}{}{You've been helpful. Thank you friend.}
{191}{}{You need to be more social. You know where they stash the booze?}
{192}{}{Too bad. I was hoping that you stiffs would have some balls.}
{193}{}{And I thought I was nuts! You'd better get outta here before someone kills you!}
{194}{}{Please don't kill me! I'll tell you what you want to know.}
{195}{}{What's going on around here?}
{196}{}{Where's the Master?}
{197}{}{Who's in charge here?}
{198}{}{Who the hell wants to know anything? I just like to smell a person's fear before I kill them. Man, what a high!}
{199}{}{I hear we're moving north, or planning to move north soon. They don't tell us much except all the usual bullshit. But what are we doing talking about this out in the open? You must be nuts!}
{200}{}{[Laughs] Me, I'd rather screw someone rather than get screwed. But we shouldn't talk like this out in the open. The zombies don't like it.}
{201}{}{Ya know, there are a lot of other people around here who think like that. Go bother them.}
{202}{}{I ain't saying nothing to you, pal. Go to hell.}
{203}{}{The guy dresses in black, he does his preacher act, then he goes upstairs and counts his scrip. Man, I wish I had it that easy! But I better stop talking about him behind his back, or the Nightkin might hear.}
{204}{}{What are you afraid of?}
{205}{}{I want to know more.}
{206}{}{Where's all the caps around here?}
{207}{}{What's he preaching about?}
{208}{}{Bring 'em on! I could use a little action!}
{209}{}{There's Lasher. Man, stay away from him! He's completely... I dunno if I can really describe him. Imagine the one person on Earth you don't wanna know. Lasher's worse.}
{210}{}{Does he and Morpheus get along?}
{211}{}{What's his role in the scheme of things?}
{212}{}{So what's he done? What makes him so bad?}
{213}{}{Hey, you ain't met me yet, pal!}
{214}{}{In future, find somebody else to bug.}
{215}{}{Man, I wish we had some of that stuff! After hours of listening to 'Hail this' and 'Peace', 'Unity', and the Bullshitting Way, I wanna get drunk too!}
{216}{}{You got to be kidding. This place is a church! There's gotta be booze!}
{217}{}{No booze? Shit!}
{218}{}{If I don't get enough booze, I start drinking blood.}
{219}{}{That's Morpheus. Our leader. He's up in the tower, I think.}
{220}{}{Leader? What's he leading you to?}
{221}{}{C'mon, man. That tells me nothing. Share some of the dirt!}
{222}{}{Who else is important in this joint?}
{223}{}{You've been helpful. Thank you friend.}
{224}{}{He got any booze on him? Is there any smooch in the joint?}
{225}{}{Hmm, a nice private place, nobody to bother me when I kill him.}
{226}{}{You gotta be joking. The Nightkin are killers. You look at them the wrong way, and they'll cut off your body parts, cook 'em, and feed them to you a piece at a time. They can't be killed. They're the Master's enforcers and they're gonna tear apart the world for him. And I ain't saying nothing else!}
{227}{}{There ain't nothing else to tell, and if you're smart, you don't wanna know!}
{228}{}{I dunno. I looked for them myself! I hear Morpheus got a stash, but the Nightkin guard the main one. I've known guys who went looking around for secret passages who were never seen again. I stopped looking after awhile, and if you're smart, you won't start! Ain't worth it!}
{229}{}{You gotta be joking. Talk to the zombies, man!}
{230}{}{Maybe you belong together after all!}
{231}{}{There ain't any booze man! Life's a bigger bitch than Lasher! Now why don't you go find someone else to talk to you, you little puke? Get outta here!}
{232}{}{Don't give me bullshit, pal. What do you really want?}
{233}{}{Have you noticed any unusual happenings around here?}
{234}{}{What's going on around here?}
{235}{}{Where's the Master?}
{236}{}{Just looking for a friend.}
{237}{}{All I want is some booze. Maybe some radscorpion juice?}
{238}{}{I want some boy with a punk attitude to piss me off enough that I'll remove his tongue, preserve it, and wear it on a necklace as a reminder of just how stupid people can be.}
{239}{}{The Master can kiss my ass. Just as long as I end up on the winning side, I don't give a shit. You got that, zombie!}
{240}{}{Finally! I've found a real human being in this place!}
{241}{}{My friend? Why is your life so filled with pain and suffering? Open your heart to the Master!}
{242}{}{How can you survive around here with that attitude?}
{243}{}{Yeah, you made it pretty clear.}
{244}{}{I give a shit. If someone called himself 'Master' and tried to kiss my ass, I'd kill him.}
{245}{}{Because I do my job good. I've killed three Apocalypse scum in the last month. Nobody gives me shit. You want to?}
{246}{}{I'm impressed. A guy like you must know the real story about what's going on around here...}
{247}{}{Apocalypse, eh? They're supposed to be tough?}
{248}{}{Three? That's all? You should see my body count!}
{249}{}{Nope.}
{250}{}{I'll bet yours didn't scream as loudly as mine did. I like it when they scream.}
{251}{}{Hey! A guy with a weapon's still a guy with a weapon! You think you can do better?}
{252}{}{No, my friend. I am devoted to peace, love, and unity.}
{253}{}{A guy with a weapon is dangerous. A guy or a woman with a weapon AND a brain is lethal.}
{254}{}{A guy with a weapon is dangerous. A guy with a weapon AND a brain is lethal.}
{255}{}{Yeah, I can do better.}
{256}{}{No way to tell. You wanna get it on and find out?}
{257}{}{Think? Who needs to think? I'll just show you what I can do. Die, asshole!}
{258}{}{I ain't heard anything about you, pal, so cut the bullshit and get out of my face.}
{259}{}{Thought so. Why don't you just go back to your zombie chants and leave the real work to guys like me.}
{260}{}{Yeah. I heard that about you. You may've killed your share of radscorpions, but I'm badder! What's your angle? Why are you here?}
{261}{}{Have you noticed any unusual happenings around here?}
{262}{}{What's going on around here?}
{263}{}{Where's the Master?}
{264}{}{Just looking for a friend.}
{265}{}{I heard the booze is pretty good around here.}
{266}{}{Wait a minute, aren't you that guy who... Oh shit, I'm outta here!}
{267}{}{Wait a minute, aren't you that woman who... Oh shit, I'm outta here!}
{268}{}{I ain't anybody's friend. I ain't that type. [long pause] I'd suggest you get out of my way, now.}
{269}{}{We try something here, and the Nightkin will tear us to pieces. Maybe we can meet outside later.}
{270}{}{Maybe. Or maybe we can both can the attitude and just talk about stuff. Like what's going on around here.}
{271}{}{Coward!}
{272}{}{Sure. Could be fun.}
{273}{}{Let's do it now.}
{274}{}{You asshole!}
{275}{}{Because people who get on his bad side don't stay alive very long!}
{276}{}{[Done]}
