{201}{}{We do not have time for you. Please be on your way now.}
{202}{}{Safe travels.}
{203}{}{I'm sorry, but we don't have the time and pelts to go through this again.}
{204}{}{You will pay for what you have done!}
{205}{}{Holster your weapon, then we can talk.}

{1000}{}{Greetings, traveler. What can we do for you?}
{1001}{}{What can we do for you?}
	{1010}{}{Who are you?}
	{1020}{}{What are you doing here?}
	{1030}{}{Prepare to die!}

{1100}{}{I am Irataba, and this is my son Cairook.}
	{1110}{}{Where are you from?}
	{1120}{}{I am }
	{1121}{}{. It is nice to meet you and your son.}
	{1130}{}{What are you doing here?}

{1200}{}{Our village is not too far from here. No offense, but I'd rather not tell you where exactly it is.}
	{1210}{}{Shame, I wanted to slaughter the whole lot of you.}

{1300}{}{Thank you. It is nice to meet a friendly face for once.}
{1301}{}{Would you like to join us? I am showing my son how to skin a gecko.}
	{1310}{}{Count me in.}
	{1320}{}{I don't have time for that right now, but thanks.}

{1400}{}{So be it. Safe travels, }
{1401}{}{.}
{1402}{}{So be it. Safe travels, stranger.}

{1500}{}{We were hunting geckos and now I am showing my son how to skin them.}
	{1510}{}{Interesting. Can you show me how to skin a gecko?}
	{1511}{}{If your offer still stands, can you show me how to skin a gecko?}
	{1520}{}{I see. Well then, goodbye.}

{1600}{}{I do not have the time to teach you, traveler.}
	{1610}{}{Well then, goodbye.}

{1700}{}{Very well. Sit down, take this knife and watch me ... [You watch and learn]}

{1800}{}{... Yes, that's it. It appears you've got the hang of it. Now if you practice some more and hone your skills, you might one day be as good as I am.}
	{1810}{}{Thanks for showing me how to do that, Irataba. I think I'll go practice on some geckos. Goodbye.}

{1900}{}{... No, not like that. You see this cut here? You ruined the skin and it became worthless.}
{1901}{}{Don't worry, this skin wasn't much worth to begin with. But you must practice more the ways of the outdoorsman. For now I don't think I can help you.}
	{1910}{}{Uh, okay. I think I'll go practice some more then. Goodbye.}
