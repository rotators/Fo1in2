{126}{}{ experience for helping Griffith leaving Necropolis.}
{127}{}{ experience for stealing the motorcycle.}

# Float: (When using the bike without owning it and having talked to Griffith at least once.)
{160}{}{You are a god damn THIEF!}
{161}{}{What the? Where is my ..?!}

{200}{}{Griffith doesn't seem to come back. Maybe you should try to find him?}
{201}{}{He sure takes his time ...}
{202}{}{Ugh ... booo-ring.}

# Dialog:
{500}{}{Get your hands off of my ride, smoothskin!}
{501}{}{I told you to stay away!}
   {510}{}{Make me!}
   {520}{}{Oh, Ok.}

{1000}{}{Hey smoothskin, what'cha lookin at?}
{1001}{}{You're still around, smoothskin?}
{1002}{}{Did you change your mind, smoothskin?}
   {1010}{}{Who are you?}
   {1020}{}{What are you doing here?}
   {1030}{}{Is that your bike?}
   {1031}{}{Can you tell me about your bike again?}
   {1040}{}{Alright, I'll watch your bike.}
   {1050}{}{Uhh... Who you?}

{1100}{}{They call me Griffith.}
   {1110}{}{What are you doing here, Griffith?}
   {1120}{}{Great. See you later, Griffith!}
   
{1200}{}{What does it look like I'm doing?}
   {1210}{}{I don't know. You're waiting for someone?}
   
{1300}{}{Exactly! And know what? Looks like I found who I was waiting for!}
   {1310}{}{Is that so?}
   
{1400}{}{There's something I need to do. It'll take me a few hours, and I can't keep my bike here unattended.}
   {1410}{}{You want me to watch your bike?}
   {1420}{}{So what do you want me to do?}
   
{1500}{}{The other ghouls 'round here, they don't give a shit and I can't trust tem.}
{1501}{}{You on the other hand, I can tell you *would* give a shit! Besides, I'll pay you if everything is still in place once I'm back.}
   {1510}{}{What's the pay?}
   {1520}{}{Guess I could do that.}

{1600}{}{A bag of caps? It's not like it's a hard job. Just takes some time, that's all.}
   {1610}{}{Guess I could do that.}
   {1620}{}{Sorry, but I don't have time for that. See you later.}
   
{1700}{}{Great! I'll be back in a few hours.}
   {1710}{}{[You watch the ghoul disappear into the sewers]}
   
{1800}{}{Smoothskin, are you stupid? I need someone to watch my bike!}
   {1810}{}{Hey, don't call me stupid!}
   {1820}{}{Oh.}

{1900}{}{It's my bike, alright.}
   {1910}{}{Can you tell me more about it?}
   {1920}{}{It looks like an original Chryslus Motors Cruiser. I have seen them on old holo movies!}
   
{2000}{}{You're looking at an original Chryslus Motors Cruiser, build... Uhm... Actually, I don't know when it was build, but it's pre-war! Great tech. Keeping it up and running for years already.}
   {2010}{}{Do you sell it?}
   
{2100}{}{Do I ... what? Are you fucking kidding me, smoothskin? I would never sell my ride!}

{2200}{}{Well, shit. You're as useless as everyone else 'round here.}

{2300}{}{Damn straight, smoothskin! One of mankinds best machines ever made!}

{2400}{}{Seems you know more about these pre-war bikes than I do.}


# Dumb dialog:
{3000}{}{Holy brahmin, you're as dumb as it gets, aren't you?}
	{3010}{}{Uh...}

{3100}{}{Tell you what, smoothskin... There is something I need to do. Hey! Do you listen?}
{3101}{}{If you do as I say, I'll give you nice bling bling, you understand me? Look, lot's of bottle caps! You like bottle caps, do you?}
	{3110}{}{Me like!}
	{3120}{}{Nah.}

{3200}{}{You what? You don't like bottle caps, smoothkin? Damn, you must be on the real slow side.}
	{3210}{}{Me go.}
	{3220}{}{Uh, me like caps!}

{3300}{}{Great, great! Now listen. I have to go away for a bit. You understand? *I* go. *You* stay here. Make nobody touch my bike, yes? Good. It won't take too long, just wait here.}
   {3310}{}{[You watch the ghoul disappear into the sewers]}
