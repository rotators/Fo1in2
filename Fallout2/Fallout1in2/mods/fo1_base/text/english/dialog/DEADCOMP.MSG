The people of Scrapheap will lead a poorer life without their power; but with the gangs gone, at least they will have a life. Your job here is done, but your mission to find the water purification chip continues.}
{401}{}{After a long battle and much bloodshed, you prevail. With the gangs defeated, Scrapheap is a safe haven once again. The townspeople are grateful - They give you some valuable information, and your task in Scrapheap is now complete. However, the mission to find the water purification chip continues.}
