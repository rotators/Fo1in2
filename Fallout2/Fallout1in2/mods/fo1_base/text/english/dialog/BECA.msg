# Alchemist: Warning! Achtung! Uwaga!
# Beca's script is bound to the ol' black male at the Blades map, but this is
# temporary measure. Actually Quatermistress IS a women! So she must be
# referenced as 'SHE/HER' NOT 'he/his/him'. 'Jade' stands for nickname and
# 'Bec'a stands for the real one.

{120}{}{Hey again. I heard you've actually helped us. You are more than worthy of our respect, indeed. We are free now. (You are now a member of the Blades gang.)}
