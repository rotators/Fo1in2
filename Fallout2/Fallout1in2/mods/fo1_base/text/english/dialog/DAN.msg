{100}{}{You see: Dan.}
{101}{}{Help!}

{102}{}{Why hello there, m'friend and welcome to the Hub. Let me introduce m'self, they call me 'Dan The Brahma Man!' I wheel and deal with all the merchants around here, offer'n my humble services for a low, low price. So now, what can I do ya' for, }
{103}{}{young man?}
{104}{}{my man?}
{105}{}{my little lady?}
{106}{}{I want to join a caravan.}
{107}{}{Uh, what services do you offer, exactly?}
{108}{}{Why the hell are you yelling at that poor kid?!}
{109}{}{Urg.}
{110}{}{Why, I manage the care for perddy much all of the caravan's wagons and brahmin in these parts. If they ever need anything for their caravans, I'm the one they talk to. Hell, the Big Three deal with me exclusively.}
{111}{}{Who are the Big Three?}
{112}{}{Well aren't you important.}
{113}{}{Really? That's nice. I want to join a caravan.}
{114}{}{Well, I got to go. Bye.}
{115}{}{What? Get the hell out of here, ya' damn skag! Ta think I was about to waste m'time on a low-life like yerself.}
{118}{}{Damn, son. Have ya' been locked up all yer life in a cave or somethin'? The Big Three are the three largest merchant groups in the world. Well, okay, maybe not the world, but they sure as hell cover a large portion; 'bout as far as yer eye can see.}
{119}{}{Damn, honey. Have ya' been locked up all yer life in a cave or somethin'? The Big Three are the three largest merchant groups in the world. Well, okay, maybe not the world, but they sure as hell cover a large portion; 'bout as far as yer eye can see.}
{120}{}{Damn yourself, you brahma freak.}
{121}{}{Oh, them. I thought you were talking about something else. So how do I join a caravan?}
{122}{}{Okay, thanks. Bye.}
{123}{}{Brahma freak? Is that an attempt at insult'n me? I would be a little more polite to the people ya' meet, stranger. I couldn't care less, but this city is filled with all sorts of cutthroats that wouldn't hesitate to slit yer throat if ya' look at'm wrong.}
{124}{}{Damn, you're one ugly son of a bitch!}
{125}{}{I'm scared. See ya.}
{126}{}{Special, no; lucky, yes. And unless ya want to be unlucky, you'll be a little more polite to the people ya' meet. I couldn't care less, but this city is filled with all sorts of cutthroats that wouldn't hesitate to slit yer throat if ya' look at'm wrong.}
{127}{}{Damn, you're one ugly son of a bitch!}
{128}{}{If you say so.}
{129}{}{Well, at least I don't have a mutated hind for a face. Yer mother must have been a brahma and yer daddy a rat; that's the only way ya' could have come out so damn ugly. Hell, yer uglier than me!}
{130}{}{No one talks about my mother like that! Prepare to die!}
{131}{}{Yeah, not bad. Well I got places to go and people to beat. See ya', Dan.}
{132}{}{Yeah right, that's an okay line, but everyone uses it. Yer kiddin' right? Ya' wouldn't lay a hand on poor ol' Dan.}
{133}{}{Line? Hand? You wish. I'll lay much more than my hand on your soon to be dead carcass.}
{134}{}{Ha! Had you going though, didn't I?}
{135}{}{Yeah, a little maybe. Yer not too bad, kid. But just remember to keep that mouth of yers under control. I'd hate to see a good mouth go to waste.}
{136}{}{Sure, whatever you say. See ya', Dan.}
{137}{}{So, how do I join a caravan?}
{138}{}{Bye. And stay away from my brahmin, you dirty little bastard.}
{139}{}{Bye. And stay away from my brahmin, you dirty little bitch.}
{141}{}{Guards! Police! There's a madman trying to kill me!}
{142}{}{Well, I don't have any openings but ya' might wanna check with the Big Three. There's a job post in the Merchant Market that might be of some help ta ya'. That's where they, and others, get their men.}
{143}{}{Oh, sorry... and women of course.}
{144}{}{You don't have any openings? Are you a merchant, too?}
{145}{}{Which way to the Merchant Market?}
{146}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{147}{}{Well no, not exactly. I work very closely with most of the smaller merchant groups, though, and I know we're not hiring.}
{148}{}{Your loss.}
{149}{}{Okay, see ya' later, Dan.}
{150}{}{So where's this Merchant Market?}
{151}{}{Just go straight down this road. It's smack dab in the center of the Hub - ya' can't miss it.}
{152}{}{That's none of yer business, stranger.}
{153}{}{I'm going to make it my business, 'stranger'!}
{154}{}{Sorry to intrude.}
{155}{}{Why, hello again! How are ya' doin'?}
{156}{}{I want to join a caravan.}
{157}{}{Uh, what services do you offer, exactly?}
{158}{}{Why the hell where you yelling at that poor kid?!}
{159}{}{Fine. Bye.}
{160}{}{Yuk.}
{161}{}{What now?}
{162}{}{Why the hell where you yelling at that poor kid?!}
{163}{}{Nothing.}
{164}{}{Yuk.}
{168}{}{Look, that kid was caught stealin'. The police put'm in my care ta straighten'm out.}
{169}{}{That's no reason to be so mean to him.}
{170}{}{What's wrong with stealing?}
{171}{}{Oh, that's different! Give him hell!}
{172}{}{Are ya' daft? That's a quick way to rot away in a cell or get exiled without any food, clothing, or weapons.}
{173}{}{That still doesn't justify the way you're treating him!}
{174}{}{Oh, okay.}
{175}{}{I may not be the best role model in this damn city, but I'm the only one who cares and is willing ta try to help. What have ya' done to improve society?}
{176}{}{I've killed lots of things!}
{177}{}{I'm sorry, I've misjudged you.}
{178}{}{You should have just killed the brat!}
{179}{}{Well, maybe you could be just a little nicer to him. I think he's trying.}
{180}{}{You should give him a good whipping!}
{181}{}{Ya' think killing people solves the real problem?}
{182}{}{Yep!}
{183}{}{It's been working for me so far!}
{184}{}{Hmmm, maybe not.}
{185}{}{I don't know.}
{186}{}{Ya' disappoint me. Ya' seemed to have a good head on your shoulders. Killin'm might get rid of the problem temporarily, but you've gotta get at the root of the problem to really make a difference.}
{187}{}{Yeah, whatever.}
{188}{}{Uh, okay. Bye.}
{189}{}{You're an idiot.}
{190}{}{Well... (He pauses looking off into space.) Maybe yer right, partner. I'll keep that in mind, but I ain't promisin' ya' anything.}
{191}{}{Are ya' kiddin'? That'd just make'm more defiant! My ways may not be perfect, but at least I know it'll make'm stronger and more responsible.}
{192}{}{Damn straight. Kill'n the person with the disease ain't the best way. You've gotta find the cure because it's bound to surface again.}
{193}{}{No kidding, Einstein.}
{194}{}{Quit yer yappin'! Yer givin' me a headache!}
{195}{}{Uh, yeah, sure pal. I've gotta go.}
{196}{}{Well, try not ta solve all yer problems with a gun. Bye.}
{197}{}{Damn, it's hot today!}
{198}{}{Billy! Ya' better not be screw'n around, ya' little shit!}
{199}{}{Billy! Ya' better make sure those brahmin are kept warm tonight or it'll be yer hide!}
{200}{}{Damn it, you little brat! Stop yappin' and start workin'!}
{201}{}{I told you to stop screw'n around!}
{202}{}{I'm warning you, Billy!}
{203}{}{You don't want the hard way, do you?}
{204}{}{Sorry kid, can't talk. I've got a business to run.}
{208}{}{Sorry, can't talk. I've got a business to run.}
{209}{}{You'd better not be pester'n Billy; he's got a hell of a lot of work to do today.}
{210}{}{Beat it, I'm busy.}
{211}{}{Why are people always bother'n me? Can't you see I'm work'n?}
{212}{}{Talk to the merchants if you want a job. I'm not hiring.}
{213}{}{Why don't ya' go play in the Maltese Falcon? I'm busy.}
{214}{}{What the hell are you doing here? Get out!}
{215}{}{I said get out! I'm not joke'n! I'll blow yer frigg'n head off!}
{216}{}{Ya' punks will never learn, will ya'?}
