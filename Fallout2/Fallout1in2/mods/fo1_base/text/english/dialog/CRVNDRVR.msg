{100}{}{You see a caravan driver.}
{101}{}{Sorry, I don't know you. If you want a job you need to talk to Rutger.}
{102}{}{Don't talk to me about a job, talk to Rutger.}
{103}{}{What, did you spend all your money on drugs? If you keep that up you'll find your new home in Old Town, surrounded by skags.}
{104}{}{You'd better sober up. Come back when you're ready and able to work.}
{105}{}{Looking for another job?}
{106}{}{Sure.}
{107}{}{No, maybe later.}
{108}{}{Lug.}
{109}{}{Rok!}
{110}{}{Ready to go? We leave today.}
{111}{}{Yep!}
{112}{}{Nope.}
{113}{}{Hrurra?}
{114}{}{Sorry, we won't deal with you anymore. Try your luck with another caravan; maybe they'll put up with you.}
{115}{}{Sorry, we're not hiring.}
{116}{}{You've got a lot of nerve showing your face here again. I think you should leave.}
{117}{}{I said beat it!}
{118}{}{What do you want? Hiring you was a disaster.}
{119}{}{Please give me another chance! I had no choice!}
{120}{}{Oh, yeah? I couldn't care less.}
{121}{}{Nothing. Bye.}
{122}{}{Kah.}
{123}{}{Moo.}
{124}{}{Look, I don't know what happened out there, but we lost the entire caravan! You shouldn't have come back if you couldn't protect it.}
{125}{}{No way, get lost!}
{126}{}{I said get lost!}
{127}{}{What do you want?}
{128}{}{Ah, shut up and get out of my way!}
{129}{}{I want another job.}
{130}{}{Nothing.}
{131}{}{Zug.}
{132}{}{Ug.}
{133}{}{What? After you abandoned that last job? You're lucky they survived.}
{134}{}{I'm lucky? You're lucky I don't pound your face in!}
{135}{}{Hey! I had places to go and people to see.}
{136}{}{I didn't know I wasn't allowed to leave. Everything seemed okay.}
{137}{}{Talk straight or get out.}
{138}{}{Skag.}
{139}{}{We don't hire drunks.}
{140}{}{We don't hire druggies.}
{141}{}{(The caravan driver is ignoring you.)}
{142}{}{Come back when you've slept it off.}
{143}{}{You sicko. Go back to the pens.}
{144}{}{Seemed okay? You never leave a caravan, not even if it's a mile from its rendezvous. You were hired to guard it for the entire trip, otherwise we would have gotten someone else.}
{145}{}{Well, no one told me I couldn't leave!}
{146}{}{I'm sorry, it will never happen again.}
{147}{}{Up yours.}
{148}{}{What? Is this your first caravan? How did you get hired? This is a very delicate and important job; it's to be taken seriously. Lives are at stake, both the caravan and the towns we supply.}
{149}{}{And you must be so proud of yourself.}
{150}{}{What? Do you want a medal or something?}
{151}{}{Let me save lives, please! I want to help!}
{152}{}{I hope so! This is a very delicate and important job; it's to be taken seriously. Lives are at stake! The caravans and the towns we supply depend on us!}
{153}{}{You must be so proud of yourself.}
{154}{}{What? Do you want a medal or something?}
{155}{}{Let me save lives, please! I want to help!}
{156}{}{Of course I am.}
{157}{}{So, can I have another job?}
{158}{}{You're an idiot!}
{159}{}{I've got to go. Bye.}
{160}{}{Uh, yeah. This is hard and dirty work! We risk our lives for those in less fortunate places.}
{161}{}{Get a life!}
{162}{}{Oh? And what about all the less fortunate people right under your nose?}
{163}{}{You're right. Can I have another job or what?}
{164}{}{What? I don't know what you're talking about! Oh, you mean the skags? They don't count. They choose to live that way.}
{165}{}{I guess you're right.}
{166}{}{You make me sick.}
{167}{}{I've got to go.}
{168}{}{What? What'd I say?}
{169}{}{Of course I am. I'm a good person at heart... most of the time.}
{170}{}{Of course you are. Can I have another job or what?}
{171}{}{I'm out of here.}
{172}{}{That's the attitude! Too bad I can't give you another job.}
{173}{}{After all that? Oh come on, can I please can I have another job?}
{174}{}{Well, back to saving the world then.}
{175}{}{That's just fine. But don't ever expect to work for us again!}
{176}{}{Oh, please! It will never happen again!}
{177}{}{Like I'd want to!}
{178}{}{Well okay, one more chance. Our next caravan is leaving }
{179}{}{today}

{185}{}{. Let me know when you're ready to leave. It pays the standard 400 caps.}
{186}{}{Sorry, but I already made a bad mistake when I gave you a chance the last time you messed up.}
{187}{}{Great, which route did you want to take?}
{188}{}{Hi there. The caravan doesn't leave until tomorrow. You should come back then if you still want the job.}
{189}{}{I don't want the job.}
{190}{}{I'll try to make it.}
{191}{}{Okay, I'll see you then.}
{192}{}{Da.}
{193}{}{Hi there. You're early. Quite early. The next caravan doesn't leave until the }

{202}{}{Okay. It doesn't matter to me.}
{203}{}{Hell, it doesn't matter to me if you show or not. We have people looking for jobs every day. If you don't show, that's okay.}
{204}{}{I already told you: Don't worry about it. If you can't make it, I can make do.}
{205}{}{The Brotherhood of Steel}
{206}{}{L.A. Boneyard.}
{207}{}{Junktown}
{208}{}{Never mind. I don't want the job after all.}

{215}{}{Okay.}
{216}{}{Sorry, I can't wait that long.}
{217}{}{Great. I'll get your driver and the rest of the crew. Be careful out there, it's been a little rough lately.}
{218}{}{The crew's ready. We'll leave right away.}
{219}{}{All right, it'll just take a few minutes to get the crew together.}
{220}{}{All right. We'll leave for the Brotherhood as soon as I get the rest of the crew together.}
{221}{}{Okay, you'll be off to the Brotherhood as soon as I assemble the crew.}
{222}{}{Ready to go! Be sure to stay away from the mountains.}
{223}{}{L.A. Boneyard's a rough place - be careful. Make sure everyone sticks to their shifts.}
{224}{}{The crew's almost ready. I heard there was some trouble around L.A. Boneyard recently - watch your back.}
{225}{}{Okay, the caravan crew for L.A. Boneyard is ready and waiting.}

{228}{}{All right. Junktown's waiting, let's get going.}
{229}{}{Why, hello. I understand you are looking for a job. I'm surprised Rutger hired you, but I'm sure he has his reasons. Our caravans leave here three times a month: on the 8th, 18th and 28th. There are three places we go to on a regular basis: the Brotherhood of Steel, Junktown, and L.A. Boneyard. The pay is always 400 caps, and that's one way. You can come back with the caravan for another 400 caps.}
{230}{}{You've got great timing because they're all heading out today.}
