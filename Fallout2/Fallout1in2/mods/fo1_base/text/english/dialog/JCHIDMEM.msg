{100}{}{We offer healing of the body to heal the spirit. Can I help you?}
{101}{}{Yes. Help me.}
{102}{}{Who are you people?}
{103}{}{What happened to the people who were here before you?}
{104}{}{Uhn...}
{105}{}{That is fine, my child. We will examine you now.}
{106}{}{Blessed are the meek of mind. There is nothing wrong with you my child. Run along and play.}
{107}{}{You have been healed. Be more careful in the future.}
{108}{}{You are wounded.}
{109}{}{I see you are poisoned.}
{110}{}{Hmm, some radiation poisoning. Unfortunately, we cannot cure that.}
{111}{}{We require a donation of }
{112}{}{ caps before we can heal you. Is this acceptable?}
{113}{}{Yes.}
{114}{}{No.}
{115}{}{But I don't have that kind of money!}
{116}{}{Will you take }
{117}{}{ caps instead?}
{118}{}{The Children do not haggle. Now, will you accept our price?}
{119}{}{Yes. Of course I will.}
{120}{}{You can bite me!}
{121}{}{Thank you, my son. Let us pray for your healing.}
{122}{}{Thank you, my daughter. Let us pray for your healing.}
{123}{}{There you go. Peace and blessings of the Children with you.}
{124}{}{You do not have enough money. If you donate all you can, we will heal you. Is this acceptable?}
{125}{}{Yes.}
{126}{}{No.}
{127}{}{If you donate all you can, we will heal you. Is this acceptable?}
{128}{}{Yes.}
{129}{}{No.}
{130}{}{You have more than enough to make the donation. You need schooling in math, my child.}
{131}{}{We are the Children of the Cathedral. We live and work amongst those unfortunates living in the wasteland. If you ever get to L.A. Boneyard, stop by the Cathedral.}
{132}{}{Thank you.}
{133}{}{What do you do?}
{134}{}{We are the healers and teachers of peace. We heal the body to heal the spirit. All we ask is a small donation to pay for our healing supplies.}
{135}{}{Sounds like a good idea to me.}
{136}{}{Sounds like a load of crap to me.}
{137}{}{We did not ask you. I can tell you are tired of listening to our beliefs. If you need anything else, we will be here.}
{138}{}{It is the most holy of ideas. We are working toward ultimate peace in the wasteland. All creatures shall live as one.}
{139}{}{Thank you. Good day.}
{140}{}{They donated this house to us, in order that we might spread the word and perform our duty as healers.}
{141}{}{Isn't Doc Morbid upset about this?}
{142}{}{That was awfully kind of them. Thanks.}
{143}{}{Whatever that heathen soul feels is no concern of the Children. We are here to do our duty, and it shall be done.}
{144}{}{Uh, gee, thanks. Bye.}
{145}{}{Why are you doing this? We will do you no harm!}
{146}{}{You do not have any condition that needs assistance.}
