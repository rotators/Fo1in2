{100}{}{You see the Lieutenant of the Master's army.}
{101}{LIEUT1}{Now what do we have here? I've been told you wish to divulge information of the utmost importance. I do hope so.}
{102}{}{Uh, yeah.}
{103}{}{Not to someone as ugly as you.}
{104}{}{On one condition.}
{105}{}{Doh!}
{106}{LIEUT1A}{An insult. How droll. I'd define that word for you, but that would be a waste, wouldn't it. Let's get to your two choices: You can tell me what I want to know. Or I can do it... my way.}
{107}{}{I'll take 'none of the above.'}
{108}{}{Okay, but on one condition.}
{109}{}{All right, I'll tell you. It's on the other side of the mountains, far to the north. You'll find it near a strange, half-dome type rock... Now, what do I get?}
{110}{LIEUT1B}{I don't believe I offered. But I will give you my thanks for telling me where your Vault is. I'm sure the Master will be... ever so grateful.}
{111}{LIEUT2}{How nice for us both. Now, if you please, the location of your Vault.}
{112}{}{It's uh... it's uh...}
{113}{}{On one condition, pal.}
{114}{}{Fooled ya, didn't I? I'll never tell you!}
{115}{}{Okay, okay! Just don't kill me! I'll tell you everything I know!}
{116}{LIEUT3}{Conditions? How delightful. Go ahead, amuse me with your... condition.}
{117}{}{I want to go free.}
{118}{}{Put a bag over your head so I can stand being in your presence.}
{119}{}{I want to be able to ask you some questions first.}
{120}{LIEUT4}{What a splendid sense of humor. Pity I don't have one. So... the location of your Vault, if you please.}
{121}{}{All right, but can I ask you some questions first?}
{122}{}{I'm not telling and you can't make me.}
{123}{}{It's uh... it's uh...}
{124}{LIEUT5}{Why certainly, my dear human. I'm curious just to see what you'll ask.}
{125}{}{What is it you do here?}
{126}{}{Who do you work for?}
{127}{}{What do you want me for?}
{128}{}{How about I just leave now.}
{129}{LIEUT7}{My dear human, this is the great procreator! Here we'll make others of the master race and insure the Unity. It's all quite glorious, I assure you.}
{130}{}{Tell me about the Unity.}
{131}{}{Sounds like it. Why do you need all this to, uh, procreate?}
{132}{}{So, who's in charge?}
{133}{LIEUT8}{Presently, there is a slight... problem in the reproductive process. It's being attended to. For now, we must use the Vats to turn humans into Super Mutants. You'll experience that glory yourself momentarily.}
{134}{}{Oh, goody. A few more questions before I... glow?}
{135}{lieut8a}{How could I possibly refuse a request phrased like that?}
{136}{LIEUT9}{Certainly. We have all the time in the world... Trust me.}
{137}{LIEUT10}{The Unity is our goal. It is quite simple, really. Certainly, even you have noticed the steady downhill slide of civilization?}
{138}{}{Well, yeah, but...}
{139}{LIEUT11}{The Super Mutant is the next advancement in human evolution. To save the world, we will convert all the worthy individuals. Simple, efficient, glorious.}
{140}{}{So you're making everyone into big, green, ugly mutants to save the world?}
{141}{}{How are you more advanced?}
{142}{}{But there's no choice involved.}
{143}{LIEUT12}{Your human mind is rather under-equipped to handle this, so a simple yes will suffice for now. Soon everyone in the world will be converted, and peace will reign.}
{144}{}{But what about free will?}
{145}{}{You're telling me there will be no war?}
{146}{LIEUT13}{Did you make the choice to be born into this ash-covered world? We, the Super Mutants, are the best prepared for the world to come. What is free choice compared to life?}
{147}{}{Debatable point. But how are you more prepared than normal humans?}
{148}{}{But it's evil to force people to live your way!}
{149}{LIEUT14}{Intuitively obvious to the most casual observer. We are highly intelligent and immune to disease. The strong survive! It is our goal to improve the human race.}
{150}{}{Pretty lofty goal. How are you made like this?}
{151}{LIEUT15}{Ahh, the wonders of technology. Before the war, the human scientists made a drug called FEV. It was designed to make the perfect human.}
{152}{}{So you're the perfect human?}
{153}{LIEUT16}{Better. More than human. I, too, was once human. Like you, I was a slug, wallowing in the mud before being exposed to FEV and undergoing my glorious transformation.}
{154}{}{So you're planning on dipping everyone in this FEV?}
{155}{LIEUT17}{Exactly. Now you see.}
{156}{}{Uh, sure I do. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{157}{}{But it's wrong!}
{158}{LIEUT18}{Oh, how disappointing. I'd so hoped you would see the light before... Well, when you are one of us, I'm certain you'll understand. Then you'll embrace the Unity.}
{159}{}{Never! It's evil. Evil, I tell you!}
{160}{}{Maybe. Can I ask you a few more questions first?}
{161}{LIEUT19}{No war and no sickness. All Super Mutants are bound by the Unity. We are the hope for the world.}
{162}{}{Sounds delusional to me.}
{163}{}{How are you the hope of the world?}
{164}{LIEUT20}{We all work for the Master to uphold the glory of the Unity. He was the first, you see.}
{165}{}{How did you come to work for him?}
{166}{}{What's the Unity?}
{167}{LIEUT21}{Fate. Luck of the draw. I was the strongest of my batch to be dipped in the virus, and I have always supported the ideals of the Unity and the Master, for he is right. And for my devotion, I have been rewarded.}
{168}{}{What virus?}
{169}{}{So what's this Master like?}
{170}{LIEUT22}{Before the war, the humans made a virus called FEV to create the perfect man. They were successful, as you can plainly see. The Master has been the first to truly utilize the FEV to its full potential.}
{171}{}{So where is this Master?}
{172}{}{How does it work?}
{173}{LIEUT23}{He's busy with the Children of the Cathedral. They actually consider us gods. But then, who can blame them.}
{174}{}{My, aren't we conceited?}
{175}{}{You think you're gods?}
{176}{LIEUT24}{Is honesty conceit? We're the next step in evolution. Through our Unity, the world will survive. Where is the conceit in that?}
{177}{}{How about inside that grotesque head of yours?}
{178}{}{Well, whatever you say. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{179}{LIEUT25}{Of course not. We are simply the future.}
{180}{}{I don't believe you.}
{181}{}{Before the future comes, there're a couple of other things I'm curious about.}
{182}{LIEUT26}{Oh, I suspect that's far above your ability to comprehend. But not to worry. Soon your eyes will be opened to a whole new life.}
{183}{}{What do you mean!?}
{184}{}{Before that happens, there's a couple of other things that I'm curious about.}
{185}{LIEUT27}{[The Lieutenant sighs.] Haven't you figured it out yet? You're a prime normal. Soon you'll be one of us.}
{186}{}{How does 'no way' sound?}
{187}{}{Before I become a dip like you, there's a couple of other things that I'm curious about.}
{188}{}{Why am I a prime normal?}
{189}{LIEUT28}{Go ahead, ask your questions. We are in no hurry.}
{190}{LIEUT29}{He was our guide to the life-giving virus, and he is Father to us all. And he so wants to meet you. I hope you're honored.}
{191}{}{Uh... okay. What about that virus? What is it?}
{192}{}{Before bestowing this honor, how about answering more questions?}
{193}{}{Where is he?}
{194}{LIEUT30}{The FEV was mutated by the war radiation. Those living in this desolate wasteland have been exposed to this mutant FEV, essentially inoculating them from the full effects.}
{195}{}{So?}
{196}{}{So you need those who are uncontaminated in order to make Super Mutants?}
{197}{LIEUT31}{So, you're from a Vault and have limited exposure to this mutated virus. The original FEV in the Vats should work quite well on you.}
{198}{}{And how do you know this?}
{199}{LIEUT32}{We have done extensive experiments on humans to reach this conclusion. My Master has been searching for unopened Vaults to prove his theories. And now you've come along. How thoughtful of you.}
{200}{}{You won't find it.}
{201}{}{Well before that happens, there's a couple of other things that I'm curious about.}
{202}{LIEUT33}{Oh, my, you are brighter than I thought. Now you know why we need your Vault.}
{203}{}{Too bad you won't get it.}
{204}{}{It's a big Vault. How about some more small answers first?}
{205}{LIEUT34}{Going? I believe... let me check... Why, yes, I almost laughed! How wonderfully humorous. The only place you're going is the Vat. But first, you'll tell me where your Vault is.}
{206}{}{I hope you can take rejection.}
{207}{LIEUT35}{We shall see, won't we?}
{208}{lieut35a}{Oddly enough, I do believe you do not intend to tell me. We'll have to correct that!}
{209}{LIEUT36}{Feel better now? Since torture is such a crass, yet oddly satisfying and effective technique, I'll ask you once more nicely. Where... is... the Vault?}
{210}{}{I'm. Not. Telling.}
{211}{}{You win. It's about eight or nine days' travel due east, in the side of a mountain. I'll draw you a map.}
{212}{LIEUT37}{I rather hoped you'd say that.}
{213}{LIEUT37b}{How was that? In a more... chatty mood? Now where were we? Oh, of course... the Vault.}
{214}{}{It's... it's... in your dreams.}
{215}{}{You win. It's about eight or nine days' travel due east, in the side of a mountain. I'll draw you a map.}
{216}{LIEUT38}{Ah, I feel much better. And you? Now, be a good little human and tell me where your Vault is. This is getting most tedious.}
{217}{}{Go to hell.}
{218}{}{I'll tell! Just don't hurt me anymore!}
{219}{}{I do so admire your will. Guards, take him back to his cell and get him ready for dipping. He'll tell us where his Vault is when he is one of us.}
{220}{}{If you're so sure I'll tell after dipping, then why all of this?}
{221}{LIEUT39a}{Well, you see, there is this minor drawback. Sometimes, not always, a person's memory is, um... how shall we say, interrupted by dipping. So there is a small chance you'll forget the location.}
{222}{}{So you can't afford to dip me.}
{223}{}{Looks like we're both screwed.}
{224}{LIEUT39b}{Unfortunately, at this point, I have to take the chance. I do need that information.}
{225}{}{I'll tell.}
{226}{}{You'd better hope I forget. Because if I remember any of this, your ass is mine.}
{227}{LIEUT40}{Excellent. I believe you understand. So you're sure you want to tell where the Vault is? Torture can be so enjoyable.}
{228}{}{Yes, I'm sure.}
{229}{}{Now that you mention it, no.}
{230}{}{Can I ask you a few questions first?}
{231}{LIEUT40a}{I thought you might see it my way. No second thoughts?}
{232}{}{I'll tell you everything.}
{233}{}{Yes, I changed my mind and I'll never tell.}
{234}{}{Can I ask you a few questions, first?}
{235}{LIEUT41}{Oh, this is excellent. You know, I actually doubted my officers when they said they'd captured a prime normal. It is so nice to see you.}
{236}{}{Go to hell.}
{237}{}{What do you want with me?}
{238}{}{Duh!}
{239}{LIEUT42}{Yes, you do have a way with words, don't you. And words are what we want, before...}
{240}{}{What do you mean 'before?'}
{241}{}{You won't get anything from me!}
{242}{LIEUT43}{Why, when you become one of us, of course! I can't have a perfectly good prime normal and not make it one of the Chosen Ones, now can I? After you tell me where your Vault is.}
{243}{}{Tell you? You're almost funny.}
{244}{}{On one condition.}
{245}{LIEUT44}{Oh, how commendable. Enough foolishness. Where is your Vault?}
{246}{}{I'm not telling.}
{247}{}{Well... on one condition.}
{248}{LIEUT45f}{Well, I'm quite impressed. My spies told me you were resourceful but they seemed to have underestimated your talents. Guards, capture her!}
{249}{LIEUT46}{Ahh, had a nice nap? I do hope so. But now it's time to get down to business.}
{250}{}{Go to hell.}
{251}{}{What do you want with me?}
{252}{LIEUT48}{The mind simply boggles at your intellect. Why the legions haven't bowed down at your feet by now, I'll never understand. Guards, take this idiot away!}
{253}{LIEUT50}{As I said...}
{254}{lieut51}{Like I told you before...}
{255}{LIEUT52}{Please listen closely this time. I said...}
{256}{lieut53}{I told you...}
{257}{LIEUT54}{You know, you remind me of a cockroach I once owned. I crushed it because I was annoyed with its scurrying little noises. Remember that.}
{258}{LIEUT55}{You're an annoying little human, aren't you? I'm not going to repeat it again.}
{259}{LIEUT56}{The Unity is the goal of all Super Mutants. Through the FEV virus, we will bring all of humanity together in peace.}
{260}{LIEUT57}{The Forced Evolutionary Virus was discovered by the Master many years ago. It is what makes us the Chosen Ones. But you will soon learn that, I assure you.}
{261}{LIEUT58}{The Master is father to us all.}
{262}{LIEUT59}{Nothing but a device to further our plans. No matter, all humans will be Chosen... or dead.}
{263}{LIEUT60}{The Vats are where the FEV is stored, and where you normals become one of us. Of course, some die horrible, excruciatingly painful deaths, but well, those are the breaks.}
{264}{LIEUT61}{They are humans who have not been exposed to radiation. They tend to fare better in the Vats than others. You are a perfect example of this.}
{265}{LIEUT62}{They were constructed before the war. They are also our main source of prime normals.}
{266}{LIEUT63}{Morpheus. It's quite amusing. He thinks he's so much more than just a slug the Master recruited to head his Children of the Cathedral nonsense. Ah, well. He, too, will be dipped in the Vats and he'll probably die a horrible death... I hope.}
{267}{LIEUT64}{That's not important right now.}
{268}{LIEUT65}{That question is irrelevant to the Unity.}
{269}{LIEUT66}{I won't even dignify that with an answer.}
{270}{LIEUT45m}{Well, I'm quite impressed. My spies told me you were resourceful, but they seemed to have underestimated your talents. Guards, capture him!}
{271}{LIEUT39f}{Oh, I do so admire your will. Guards, take her away and prepare her for the dipping. She'll tell us where her Vault is when she is one of us.}
{272}{LIEUT39m}{I do so admire your will. Guards, take him to his cell and prepare him for the dipping. He'll tell us where his Vault is when he is one of us.}
