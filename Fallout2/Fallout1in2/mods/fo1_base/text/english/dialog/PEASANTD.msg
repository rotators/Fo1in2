{101}{}{Oh, yah, big man running from a scary dog. Phil, you sure showed it. Yep, you sure did.}
{102}{}{What you doing, Phil? You're checking the tread on those sneakers, aren't you?}
{103}{}{Man, that dog looks hungry. It sure wants to eat you alive, Phil.}
{104}{}{That might be a little overkill for a poor defenseless animal, doncha think?}
{105}{}{That sure is a nice pooch you have there.}
{106}{}{I'm sure Phil would appreciate it if you were to get rid of his dog.}
{107}{}{Thanks for dealing with that dog.}
