{100}{}{You see a ghoul refugee.}
{101}{}{Please don't kill me.}
{102}{}{Shut up and I might let you live.}
{103}{}{Don't worry, you aren't worth it.}
{104}{}{What happened here?}
{105}{}{Gah.}
{106}{}{You... You're just gonna kill me anyway!}
{107}{}{Ah, oh. Okay.}
{108}{}{Good, stay that way.}
{109}{}{Now, tell me what happened here.}
{110}{}{You're gonna kill me!}
{111}{}{Ah, didn't you just tell me to shut up?}
{112}{}{You die now.}
{113}{}{Yes, and now I want to know what happened here.}
{114}{}{The Super Mutants attacked. We were slaughtered. They had guns and bombs, even some steam trucks. They killed my friends. The mutants just butchered us, like you're probably gonna do to me.}
{115}{}{The Super Mutants attacked. We were slaughtered. They had guns and bombs, even some steam trucks. They killed my friends. The mutants just butchered us.}
{116}{}{What's a steam truck?}
{117}{}{How did you survive?}
{118}{}{Do you know why?}
{119}{}{I don't know.}
{120}{}{Thanks.}
{121}{}{You're useless.}
{122}{}{I heard they was pissed that some human killed their men here.}
{123}{}{Oh, uh, anything else?}
{124}{}{Hmmm. Okay. Get out of here.}
{125}{}{No.}
{126}{}{Thanks.}
{127}{}{You're useless.}
{128}{}{I heard some of the sewer ghouls might have survived, but I don't like it down there.}
{129}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{130}{}{That's it?}
{131}{}{Yeah, that's it.}
{132}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{133}{}{I hid until most of the mutants left.}
{134}{}{Anything else?}
{135}{}{Some big thing that moved on wheels, but without any brahmin.}
{136}{}{Hmm, okay. Anything else?}
{137}{}{That's dumb.}
{138}{}{Hey, then why did you ask about it?}
{139}{}{That's it! Enough insolence from you!}
{140}{}{Just wanted to know. That's all.}
{141}{}{You again? What do you want now?}
{142}{}{Any more news?}
{143}{}{Just making chit-chat.}
{144}{}{Nope. Well, I did hear that more Super Mutants were coming. I don't know when.}
{145}{}{Hmm. Okay.}
{146}{}{Make it elsewhere then. I gotta keep low.}
