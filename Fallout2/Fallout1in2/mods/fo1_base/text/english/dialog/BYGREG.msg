{100}{}{You see a man. He quickly stares intensely into your eyes and then away.}
{101}{}{You see: Greg.}
{102}{}{What? Why are you talking to me? They'll hear you know.}
{103}{}{Hi, you're back. Don't talk so loud, they're out there.}
{104}{}{Okay, but keep it down, they'll come for both of us if you don't stop shouting.}
{105}{}{Who are you?}
{106}{}{Why are you so jumpy?}
{107}{}{I think they need to up your medication.}
{108}{}{Never mind.}
{109}{}{I'm... Greg... but don't let anyone else know, or they'll come find me.}
{110}{}{Jumpy? I'm not jumpy. Just careful. They all say I'm paranoid, but I'm the one that's gonna be here when they come to get us.}
{111}{}{Come to get you? Who is coming to get you?}
{112}{}{You certainly are paranoid. I'll talk to you later.}
{113}{}{Well, they are... You know, don't you? The disease was just the start. Now they're going to come and take us all. But you are just like all the rest. You won't believe me, and you'll be doomed. You mark my words: I'LL STILL BE HERE, and ALL OF THIS, INCLUDING YOU, WILL BE TAKEN. TAKEN! (He grasps his head and curls up, into a ball, squealing and thrashing about)}
{114}{}{Medication... Oh, so you're one of them, trying to get me to take my medication again... Well, you won't get me to. I WON'T TAKE IT! NO, I WON'T. THE VOICES. NO, I WON'T! YOU CAN'T MAKE ME. (He closes his eyes shut and clutches his head frantically, talking with the voices that only he can hear)}
{115}{}{YOU CAN'T MAKE ME!}
{116}{}{NOTHING YOU CAN DO WILL HELP!}
{117}{}{IT'S ALL OVER!}
{118}{}{THEY'RE COMING, AND YOU CAN'T STOP THEM!}
{119}{}{IT WILL GET YOU ALL!}
