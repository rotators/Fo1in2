{113}{}{So, you think you can take on the Regulator wimps? Here, I'll teach you how to use that blade.}
{114}{}{You seem to have gotten better. Now go kick Caleb's butt into next year for me.}
{115}{}{Great job on hacking up those Regulators. What can I do for you?}
{116}{}{Can you teach me some more blade skills?}
{117}{}{How can I get through to the Gun Runners?}

{122}{}{There you go. You've shown a little improvement. Good luck to you.}
{123}{}{Sure thing. Come back when you want more training.}
