{100}{}{You see: Caleb, leader of the Regulators.}
{101}{}{You see a stern man in his thirties.}
{102}{}{You should know that we don't like strangers here. What do you want?}
{103}{}{Good day. May I be of some assistance?}
{104}{}{I'm}
{105}{}{You have the look of someone important.}
{106}{}{Can you tell me a little about Adytum?}
{107}{}{Can you tell me what's going on here in L.A. Boneyard?}
{108}{}{What's the history behind the Regulators?}
{109}{}{Tell me more about the Children and the Followers.}
{110}{}{Where can I find Zimmerman?}
{111}{}{Have a nice day. Thanks.}
{112}{}{Nice enough town. Me an' the Regulators work hard to keep it that way. Anyone in particular you want to know about?}
{113}{}{Who runs Adytum?}
{114}{}{Who does trading here?}
{115}{}{Nothing else, thanks.}
{116}{}{Stay out of trouble, got it? I'm Caleb, and that's a name for you to remember, 'cause I'll be the one comin' after you if you screw up.}
{117}{}{I'm Caleb. I train and organize the Regulators here.}
{118}{}{Yeah, I guess. You got the Blades up north, a pretty pathetic herd of people, and the Gun Runners a little north and a ways to the east through the Deathclaw playground.}
{119}{}{Also, a ways to the south of here you have the Children of the Cathedral, who run a hospital an' a big church. Up a little bit to the north and to the east you got the loony Followers of the Apocalypse, who are all peace-types.}
{120}{}{Stay out of trouble.}
{121}{}{You have a good day, too.}
{122}{}{You back again?}
{123}{}{How c'n I help ya', son?}
{124}{}{What c'n I do fer ya', miss?}
{125}{}{You'd best keep your weapons put away while you're in town.}
{126}{}{Guga gu.}
{127}{}{Sorry, but I don't have time for you. Run along.}
{128}{}{Adytum here is run by Jon Zimmerman. He's an upright fella, takes good care o' the town. You should go an' see 'im. Anything else?}
{129}{}{Tine runs a shop over near the gates. It's down below the little bunker. He does all th' tradin' with the Hub and with outsiders like you. Anything else?}
{130}{}{We are the police force for Adytum. Most folks 'round here know enough not to cause any trouble.}
{131}{}{I'm in charge of training the Regulators an' makin' sure that the skags are working hard enough, and that no one moves in on us here. Anythin' else?}
{132}{}{Well, the Children of the Cathedral all live in this big, black, church-type building. They have some sort of big god, an' they go around tryin' to convert people to their cult.}
{133}{}{You'll find him in the big building to the southwest. He might be able to put enough sentences together to let you know that we're looking for some help with the Blades.}
{134}{}{What's going on with the Blades?}
{135}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{136}{}{Thanks for the info. Goodbye.}
{137}{}{Sure. What else do you want to know?}
{138}{}{They've done something to Zimmerman's half-witted son. But like I said, go talk to Zimmerman about it.}
{139}{}{Can I ask you something else?}
{140}{}{Alright, I get the picture. I'll go talk to Zimmerman.}
{141}{}{So, Zimmerman gave you the scoop on the Blades. Whatever. I'm sure he'll want to know when you've done the job.}
{142}{}{Where are the Blades?}
{143}{}{Why haven't you guys taken care of it yourself?}
{144}{}{Yeah, I'll be back when the job's done.}
{145}{}{They're all to the north of here. You won't be able to miss their stench. Anything else?}
{146}{}{'Cause its a waste of our time. I got better things to do than get out there and kill a few skags. Take more time showerin' up afterwards than dealin' with them. Anything else?}
{147}{}{So, you're back. Go talk to Zimmerman.}
