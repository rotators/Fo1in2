{100}{}{You see: Deputy Fry.}
{101}{}{Hello, friend. Deputy Tony Fry at your service.}
{102}{}{What is this place?}
{103}{}{Get out of my way or they'll have to plant you six feet under.}
{104}{}{I didn't do it.}
{105}{}{Nice to meet you. Bye.}
{106}{}{Wug.}
{107}{}{Ack!}
{108}{}{Oh, a newcomer! Welcome to the Hub! I thought you were part of the caravans. Did you come in with them?}
{109}{}{Yes.}
{110}{}{No.}
{111}{}{I'm not surprised. Most of the new members of our city come in with the caravans, even with the missing caravans we've had. It's a fine city, but be careful who you associate with. People like Decker and his thugs can get you into a lot of trouble.}
{112}{}{Who's Decker?}
{113}{}{Missing caravans?}
{114}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{115}{}{That's surprising. It's been pretty rough out there, especially with the missing caravans. But you're safe now, just stay away from the Maltese Falcon. They're a bunch of troublemakers, Decker and his crew.}
{116}{}{Who's Decker?}
{117}{}{Missing caravans?}
{118}{}{Yeah, well, I'm pretty rough.}
{119}{}{Guess so. So did you have any other questions?}
{120}{}{Who's Decker?}
{121}{}{What was that about missing caravans?}
{122}{}{That's it, thanks.}
