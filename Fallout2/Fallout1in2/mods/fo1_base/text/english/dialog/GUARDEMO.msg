{100}{}{A Junktown guard.}
{101}{}{This is Junktown. Nice place to live, as long as you stay on our good side.}
{102}{}{Watch out for Gizmo and his cronies.}
{103}{}{I like my boss.}
{104}{}{You'd better put that away. Junktown is a friendly place, friend, and we want to keep it that way.}
{105}{}{Put what away?}
{106}{}{Don't tell me what to do, loser boy.}
{107}{}{Sounds fair. By the way, what is the local law regarding weapons?}
{108}{}{Uh oh.}
{109}{}{Your weapon, idiot. Killian won't take your arms away, but you'd better damn well keep them in your holster.}
{110}{}{Oh, sorry.}
{111}{}{No way! I'm not putting down my shooters for nobody!}
{112}{}{You'd better behave, since it's the law, and I enforce the law. Put your weapon away, don't draw it unless in self-defense, and you won't have a problem with us guards.}
{113}{}{[More]}
{114}{}{Disobey the law, and we will return you to the lawless wasteland - dead or alive.}
{115}{}{Sure, since you put it that way.}
{116}{}{Bite your laws!}
{117}{}{Well, uh, fine with me. But you'd better be careful.}
{118}{}{Fine, then. Heh.}
{119}{}{Good you asked. No weapons can be drawn except in self-defense. If you start a fight, it's your fault. Other than that, it's your right to go around armed. Just don't pull a knife or gun without just cause. Have a good day.}
{120}{}{Thanks - you, too.}
{121}{}{Hey you, no weapons! And I don't care if your momma dropped you on your head as a kid. No weapons.}
{122}{}{Dorf!}
{123}{}{You earn 150 experience for killing the guard.}
