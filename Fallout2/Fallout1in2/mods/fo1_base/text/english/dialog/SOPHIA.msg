{100}{}{You see: Sophia, an instructor for the Brotherhood Initiates.}
{101}{}{Okay, does anyone have any questions?}
{102}{}{Remember to ask questions if you don't understand something. Don't be shy.}
{103}{}{Review your notes.}
{104}{}{We'll be having another test tomorrow for those of you that are on section 14.}
{105}{}{I'm sorry, but I can't talk right now. I have a class to run.}
{106}{}{I understand you have something for me.}
{107}{}{Yes. Here you are.}
{108}{}{Yes, but I don't have it with me right now.}
{109}{}{You.}
{110}{}{I'm sorry, but I have a class to run. Please don't disturb me.}
{111}{}{You shouldn't be here. Vree doesn't like to be bothered at night. This is the time we meditate.}
{112}{}{We are meditating. Please leave. Come back in the morning.}
{113}{}{Leave us.}
{114}{}{Have some respect. Don't bother someone while they're meditating.}
{115}{}{You Initiates have a lot to learn. Please leave.}
{116}{}{Don't bother me.}
{117}{}{We are not available during the night. Please see us in the morning.}
{118}{}{It's night. You should be in bed, unless you have guard duty, in which case you should be at your post.}
{200}{}{Hello Initiate. How may I help you?}
{201}{}{I understand you have something for me?}
{202}{}{Yes, here you are.}
{203}{}{Yes, but I don't have it with me right now.}
{204}{}{Me? Nope, sorry. You must have me mistaken for someone else.}
{205}{}{Uk.}
{206}{}{Thank you very much. It was nice of you to drop these off.}
{207}{}{Um, thank you. Are you okay? Well anyway, it was nice of you to drop these off.}
{208}{}{My research would have been delayed without them. It's good to see we have such a trustworthy Initiate. I knew getting an outsider wouldn't be a bad decision. If you go see Michael he will have something for you.}
{301}{}{Greetings. I have not seen you here before, are you lost? May I be of service?}
{302}{}{Uh...}
{303}{}{Could you direct me to the library?}
{304}{}{I am looking for Vree.}
{305}{}{What is this place?}
{306}{}{If I was lost I wouldn't be asking an idiot like you for help!}
{307}{}{I can't believe the kind of people we accept as Initiates these days. God help us.}
{308}{}{This is the library. Here we keep records of all technical data on weaponry and technology, and, of course, the history of the Brotherhood.}
{309}{}{I need a Water Chip repaired. Can you help me?}
{310}{}{I'd like to know more about the weapons you make here.}
{311}{}{Is this the place where I would find holodisks?}
{312}{}{Never mind, thank you for your time.}
{313}{}{I'm looking for a big gun to improve my people-killing skills.}
{314}{}{I am Vree's assistant. Vree is over there.}
{315}{}{Thank you.}
{316}{}{What is it you do as Vree's assistant?}
{317}{}{My area of expertise is the history of the Brotherhood. It sounds like a manufacturing problem, perhaps you should ask Vree?}
{318}{}{I thought the Scribes knew this kind of stuff.}
{319}{}{I'd like to know about the Brotherhood's history.}
{320}{}{Lotta help you are!}
{321}{}{Okay, thanks for your help.}
{322}{}{You must speak with Vree, the Head Scribe, about that. I have more important things to do.}
{323}{}{I will go ask Vree.}
{324}{}{More important things to do? Like what?}
{325}{}{You don't consider the Brotherhood's weaponry to be important?}
{326}{}{We have many holodisks here in the library. They are divided between history, technology and weapon design.}
{327}{}{I would like to see a holodisk on your technology.}
{328}{}{I would like to see a holodisk on weapon design.}
{329}{}{I would like to see a holodisk on the Brotherhood's history.}
{330}{}{I was sent here to ask Vree about the history of the Brotherhood.}
{331}{}{My area of specialty is the Brotherhood's history. It seems that some people around here have forgotten the importance of our history.}
{332}{}{What can you tell me about the Brotherhood's history?}
{333}{}{What could be more important than history?}
{334}{}{Must be near your time of the month, huh?}
{335}{}{I'd like to ask somebody about weapons.}
{336}{}{Like keeping the history of the Brotherhood. It seems some people around here have forgotten just how important our history is.}
{337}{}{Vree seems to think that the research of new weaponry and the information gathered from Mutant autopsies is more important than our history. She has forgotten that our history is a vital part of our lives. It has gotten so bad that many of the new Initiates don't even know who Roger Maxson is or what exactly he did for us.}
{338}{}{I'd like to learn more about the Brotherhood's history. Do you have any information you can give me?}
{339}{}{Hmmm, it looks like Vree is the person I want to talk to. Goodbye.}
{341}{}{It sounds like Vree's got the right idea! Who needs to know this garbage anyway!?!}
{342}{}{I agree that history is important, but new technology and better weapons is what I'm looking for.}
{343}{}{You need to speak with Vree about things of that nature.}
{344}{}{These are things that only Scribes and Paladins have access to. Vree may be able to help you.}
{345}{}{Thank you, I'll go ask Vree.}
{346}{}{Is there any holodisks that I can have access to?}
{347}{}{You're obviously not the right person to be talking to. Goodbye.}
{348}{}{Well, it's good to see someone interested in our great history. Unlike others around here. Here you go. This is a disk of some of our earliest writings.}
{349}{}{Thank you.}
{350}{}{I don't care about this crap. Thanks for nothing.}
{351}{}{Our history is available to everyone. So that they may learn of our great history... Not that anyone ever looks at them.}
{352}{}{I would like to see anything you have on the Brotherhood's history.}
{353}{}{Really? I don't care either, just show me the guns.}
{354}{}{Greetings. I have not seen you here before, are you lost? May I be of service?}
{355}{}{Uh...}
{356}{}{Could you direct me to the library?}
{357}{}{I was sent here to speak with Vree about the Brotherhood's history.}
{358}{}{If I was lost I wouldn't be asking an idiot like you for help!}
{359}{}{You didn't get far with that did you? Vree is too busy with her 'experiments' to care about history any more.}
{360}{}{Well, then who can I talk to about the history of the Brotherhood?}
{361}{}{Yeah, the Brotherhood seems to be filled with idiots.}
{362}{}{Neither do I. Goodbye.}
{363}{}{I will not talk with you.}
{364}{}{How can I help you?}
{365}{}{What do you do here?}
{366}{}{Could you tell me about the Brotherhood's history.}
{367}{}{Sorry, I thought you were someone else. Goodbye.}
{368}{}{I am Vree's assistant.}
{369}{}{Thank you.}
{370}{}{What is it you do as Vree's assistant?}
{371}{}{Well, it's good to see someone interested in our great history. Unlike others around here. Here you go. This is a disk of some of our earliest writings.}
{372}{}{Thank you.}
{373}{}{I don't care about this crap. Thanks for nothing.}
{374}{}{I gave you the disk with some of our early writings on it. Just load it up into your Pip-Boy 2000 and you will be able to read it.}
{375}{}{Thank you.}
{376}{}{I don't care about this crap. Thanks for nothing.}
{377}{}{I don't like your attitude, and I choose not to talk to you.}
{378}{}{So be it. Goodbye!}
{379}{}{I'm sorry, I was very rude and I apologize.}
{380}{}{I accept your apology. Now how can I help you? }
{381}{}{What do you do here?}
{382}{}{Could you tell me about the Brotherhood's history.}
{383}{}{Sorry, I thought you were someone else. Goodbye.}
{384}{}{I am Vree's assistant. Vree is in the Learning Center.}
{400}{}{You see an instructor for the Brotherhood Initiates.}
