{100}{}{You see: Jerry, a young Initiate.}
{101}{}{You see a Knight Initiate.}
{102}{}{You see a Scribe Initiate.}
{103}{}{Hi there! You must be Brother }
{104}{}{, the new Initiate from the outside. My name's Jerry, I'm your new roommate. I'm an Initiate too! I've been studying so hard. Are you an Initiate Knight or Scribe?}
{105}{}{I haven't decided.}
{106}{}{Knight.}
{107}{}{Scribe.}
{108}{}{Uk.}
{109}{}{Yeah, being a Knight would be great, they see lots of action and get to build all the stuff. I haven't decided yet, but I'm leaning towards being a Knight myself. Am I boring you? Some people say I talk a lot but I just don't think they understand. I just have a lot to say.}
{110}{}{No, not at all.}
{111}{}{I've got to go. Nice meeting you.}
{112}{}{Yeah, Scribes have such a creative position. It would be great to think up new weapons, modify old ones, and keep records of every  detail of every item in the Brotherhood. Am I boring you? Some people say I talk a lot but I just don't think they understand. I just have a lot to say.}
{113}{}{Yeah, I'm still trying to decide. It's so tough, they're both really exciting. By the way, if you want the top bunk just let me know, I don't mind.}
{114}{}{Thanks, bye.}
{115}{}{Are you all right? Maybe you need to see the doctor or maybe you just need some sleep. Well I better get back to studying. Bye.}
{116}{}{Oh, by the way, I'm glad you'll be my new roommate. My last one always wore ear plugs, I don't know why. Anyhow, feel free to leave anything you like here, I don't take up much space. Do you want the top bunk? I'll change if you want... you don't snore do you? Oh, it doesn't matter. See ya.}
{117}{}{Yeah, that's what I thought. Well, I'm glad you'll be my new roommate. My last one always wore earplugs, I don't know why. Anyhow, feel free to leave anything you like here, I don't take up much space. Do you want the top bunk? I'll change if you want... you don't snore do you? Oh, it doesn't matter. See ya.}
{118}{}{Just let me know if I'm snoring.}
{119}{}{Thomas says I talk too much.}
{120}{}{Talus says I'd be a good Knight if I didn't talk so much.}
{121}{}{Nice to see you again, roommate!}
{122}{}{I didn't sleep well last night.}
{123}{}{Hi again.}
{124}{}{I get to go on a patrol tomorrow.}
{125}{}{I'll be a Senior Initiate in a few years.}
{126}{}{This isn't your room, please leave.}
{127}{}{I think you're in Jerry's room.}
{128}{}{Good luck, you get to room with Jerry the Mouth.}
{129}{}{What are you doin in here?}
{130}{}{Are you an Initiate too?}
{131}{}{Visiting?}
{132}{}{Your room is the first one on the left as you come in.}
