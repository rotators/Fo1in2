{100}{}{You see a lean and unkempt boy.}
{101}{}{I don't think I should talk to you. Go away.}
{102}{}{Why do you have a weapon drawn? We don't got nothing, not even fish!}
{103}{}{Hi. Wha'cha want?}
{104}{}{How's the fishing?}
{105}{}{I'm running a little low on supplies...}
{106}{}{Seen anything unusual lately?}
{107}{}{Want to hear about my adventures in the radscorpion caves?}
{108}{}{Runk!}
{109}{}{Hi. Aren't you that person who goes around helping people? You must got lots of interesting stories to tell!}
{110}{}{Where do you come from?}
{111}{}{Hi there. I see you're not stupid enough to be fishing here. What's up?}
{112}{}{Not sure. Dad and I have been wandering the wastes for so long. We had a friend, a scorpion hunter with us, but he went nuts and we had to kill him, and then we...}
{113}{}{Hmmm, maybe I shouldn't talk about that.}
{114}{}{Tell me about your dad.}
{115}{}{What about scorpions?}
{116}{}{It sucks. Sorry, I shouldn't use the word 'suck'. Dad thinks that people who say suck all the time are either brain-dead simpletons or inarticulate losers. Dad's always trying to sound smart.}
{117}{}{I agree with your father.}
{118}{}{Sorry. I'm not the one to talk to about supplies.}
{119}{}{I saw a big thing like a giant spider with two heads, and one head looked human. Dad thinks I sucked up too much radiation. I dunno. Contaminated water does weird stuff to the brain.}
{120}{}{Yeah, like what?}
{121}{}{What's a 'runk'?}
{122}{}{Sure!}
{123}{}{The worst thing about hunting radscorpions is waiting for them to get into a good ambush spot.}
{124}{}{The worst thing about hunting radscorpions is chasing them down after they run away!}
{125}{}{The worst thing about hunting radscorpions is getting stung in the face by their stinger.}
{126}{}{Yeah. Did you ever hear about the raiders who fell into the radscorpion nest and they all got stung and stung and eaten alive, except for the one who ran away with half his face chewed off!}
{127}{}{Man, that was a good one!}
{128}{}{Well he's kind of loud and boring, and I ain't sure he's my real dad. I think he musta stole me when I was a baby. But he feeds me most of the time, so I like him, I guess.}
{129}{}{They're big and they're nasty, and they're getting outta control. Dad said there used to be heroes who'd wander around the wastes and kill them off, but most of them are dead now, I guess.}
{130}{}{What kind of heroes?}
{131}{}{Yeah, adults always agree with each other. It's just stupid.}
{132}{}{Big Henry used to go with us, and he was better'n dad and me, until he went insane and tried to strangle me. Dad had to shoot him!}
{133}{}{Is your dad a good shot?}
{134}{}{Who's Big Henry?}
{135}{}{Well that sounds great! I'd better get back to fishing though, or we're gonna get so hungry, we're gonna have to eat you!}
{136}{}{A lot of heroes. The guy who founded the Brotherhood of Steel, Roger Maxim, he was a real good scorpion killer. When I get older, I'm gonna find out where they are and join them!}
{137}{}{Sounds good.}
{138}{}{It's really hard to join the Brotherhood. And it's a long dangerous trip.}
{139}{}{He's okay, I guess. Actually, I saw him hit a radscorpion between the eyes at seventy yards, but it was a fluke shot.}
{140}{}{He was a guy from down south. Some sort of raider who tried to live off the land, not the people. He was a real great guy, but sometimes he'd go nuts, and one time he... uh... it don't matter.}
{141}{}{Yeah. I'm gonna be a he-ro, just like him. You bet on it!}
{142}{}{You think living like this is easy? I ain't scared of hardship and there ain't nothing safe out here, so I ain't quitting. I just gotta get old enough to strike out on my own.}
{143}{}{What about the battle between a radscorpion and a man?}
{144}{}{Only about twelve times...}
{145}{}{Uh, yes sir.}
{146}{}{I think this time I'll catch a cold...}
{147}{}{Hurry up! I'm starving!}
{148}{}{It's been so long since you caught anything, I've forgotten what it tastes like.}
{149}{}{Dad, did you hear something...?}
