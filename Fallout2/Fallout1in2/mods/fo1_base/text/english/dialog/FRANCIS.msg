{100}{}{You see: Sister Francis.}
{101}{}{Hi! Oh, it's you! I hope you're not here to kill me. If you don't mind, could you wait until after I finish meditating?}
{102}{}{Oh, it's you again. I don't mean to be rude, but I am meditating...}
{103}{}{Excuse me, could you put away your weapon? I can't meditate on peace when I'm like, uh, staring certain death in the face. Thank you very much.}
{104}{}{You know, there are people who say really bad things about you. You ought to do something about that...}
{105}{}{Hi. I'm meditating. Did you notice? Can I help you?}
{106}{}{Sure. You notice anything unusual around here?}
{107}{}{Care to share any favorite meditations with me?}
{108}{}{Who's in charge here?}
{109}{}{Where can I find the Master?}
{110}{}{I'm looking for large quantities of liquor. I'd like to remove them from the premises...}
{111}{}{Got any ammo?}
{112}{}{Hep! Me hep?}
{113}{}{Hello, brother. Can I help you?}
{114}{}{Hello, sister. Can I help you?}
{115}{}{Sure. You notice anything unusual around here?}
{116}{}{Care to share any favorite meditations with me?}

{118}{}{Where can I find the Master?}
{119}{}{I'm looking for large quantities of liquor. I'd like to remove them from the premises...}
{120}{}{Got any ammo?}

{129}{}{Well, Father Morpheus hasn't given any sermons in such a long time. It's a pity, because I so love his speeches and everybody seems to be very busy with some Crusade.}

{130}{}{ Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go back to meditating.}
{131}{}{Well, I could, but the ones who go through the Servitor process are so much better than I am... Their minds are so much more focused on the Master than mine. Maybe after I get changed, I'll get better.}

{132}{}{ Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go back to meditating.}
{133}{}{Why, that's Father Morpheus. He's such a good speaker, he really makes Peace and Unity come to life, and when he talks, I can just see those Holy Flames!}
{134}{}{That Father Morpheus, he sure can talk; and he's handsome, too!}
{135}{}{I think that's one of the Inner Mysteries that the priests discuss upstairs in the Inner Sanctum. I have not been privileged enough for that revelation yet, but I'm working at it!}
# Space of " Now" at beginning of line is intentional!
{136}{}{ Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go back to meditating.}
{137}{}{My goodness! Alcohol and drugs here?! You must be mistaken. The Master would never tolerate it. He wants all of his followers to keep their minds healthy and pure.}
# Space of " Now" at beginning of line is intentional!
{138}{}{ Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go back to meditating.}
{139}{}{I think holy ammunition is available in the Cathedral Gift Shoppe...}
# Space of " Now" at beginning of line is intentional!
{140}{}{ Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go back to meditating.}
{141}{}{Why, no. No help at all. Goodbye.}
{142}{}{Hello, brother. No, I've been meditating like a good Initiate, waiting to be christened by the Servitors. I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.}
{143}{}{Hello, sister. No I've been meditating like a good Initiate, waiting to be christened by the Servitors. I'm sure there's nothing to worry about.}
{144}{}{The Master is my friend. Unity is prosperity. Peace is prosperity. Peace and Unity come through obedience. Obedience is proven through submission to authority...}
{145}{}{He who submits will be christened by the Holy Flame, but the faithful will not be burned. He who goes through Fire without burning shall have life everlasting...}
{146}{}{I hope I didn't miss anything...}
{147}{}{Is this a trick question? It's the Master, right?}
{148}{}{Well I've heard that the Master can be found in Holy Fire, that he waits below for Unity and Peace, and he lives in the hearts and minds of all virtuous people...}
{149}{}{I'm not sure which of these is a metaphor. Maybe he's everywhere.}
{150}{}{Why, brother, nothing so impure profanes the Cathedral. I would let the High Priests know if such sins were being committed.}
{151}{}{Why, sister, nothing so impure profanes the Cathedral. I would let the High Priests know if such sins were being committed.}
{152}{}{I am armed, of course, if reason will not sway our enemies, but I do not arm myself to excess. Is there no ammo in the Gift Shoppe?}
{153}{}{Oh no, brother, I do not require assistance. Please excuse me.}
{154}{}{Oh no, sister, I do not require assistance. Please excuse me.}
{155}{}{Well, I am told that the Peace and Unity we seek for all creatures is unusual, but I hope this will not be the case for much longer.}

{156}{}{ Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go back to meditating.}
{157}{}{I don't know. Perhaps he will reveal himself in time.}
{158}{}{[Done]}
{159}{}{[More]}
{160}{}{Hello, sir. Can I help you?}
{161}{}{Hello, miss. Can I help you?}
