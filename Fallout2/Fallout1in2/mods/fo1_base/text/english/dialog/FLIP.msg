{100}{}{You see: Flip.}
{101}{}{You see a huge mutant.}
{102}{}{Arrrghhh! Die, infidel!}
{103}{}{You should be in the control room. Do not tarry.}
{104}{}{So, a human. This is very interesting. You will come with me to the Lieutenant, or you will perish right here.}
{105}{}{Never!}
{106}{}{Okay, I give up. Let's go.}
{107}{}{Lop!}
{108}{}{Excellent. Come with me if you want to live.}
{109}{}{Okay. Let's go.}
{110}{}{After you.}
{111}{}{You think me moronic, like many of my kind. You are sadly mistaken. It is a terminal problem, I understand.}
{112}{}{We meet again. You will not escape me this time.}
{113}{}{Don't you come near her! I'll kill you first!}
{114}{}{Flip, when will I get out of here?}
{115}{}{Soon. Very soon. Your time is near.}
{116}{}{I can't wait to be together again.}
{117}{}{You will not regret your decision, dearest. The dipping is painful...}
{118}{}{Not too much, I hope.}
{119}{}{The FEV is very painful, but you will live.}
{120}{}{And you will join us. In body and soul.}
{121}{}{We will be together again?}
{122}{}{Yes, dearest. Yes.}
{123}{}{I love you.}
{124}{}{And I you.}
