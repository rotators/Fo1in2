{100}{}{You see: Rhombus.}
{101}{}{Tell me about yourself.}
{102}{}{Can you give me some history behind the Brotherhood?}
{103}{}{Heard any good rumors?}
{104}{}{What can you tell me about the surrounding area?}
{105}{Rhom1}{May I help you?}
{106}{}{Can I ask you a few questions?}
{107}{}{You don't look like much of a fighter.}
{108}{}{Uhhh?}
{109}{Rhom2}{Yes.}
{110}{Rhom3}{Insolent pup. Apologize now and you'll not be hurt.}
{111}{}{I was trying to make a joke. I'm very sorry.}
{112}{}{What, by you?}
{113}{Rhom4}{What do you want?}
{114}{}{Can I ask a few questions?}
{115}{}{Just how cowardly are you?}
{116}{Rhom5}{You are a disgrace to the Brotherhood. I will teach you manners.}
{117}{Rhom6}{I will waste no more time with you.}
{118}{Rhom7}{I am Rhombus, head of the Paladins. I train those willing to learn.}
{119}{}{Okay, can you teach me some stuff?}
{120}{}{Is that it? That's your life?}
{121}{}{What do the Paladins do?}
{122}{Rhom8}{Stuff? I could teach you how to fight... if you had any ability. But the High Elder decreed no training of new recruits until the threat of invasion passes.}
{123}{}{What threat?}
{124}{}{Why has he stopped the training?}
{125}{}{I could easily defeat you in battle.}
{126}{Rhom9}{It is not my place to answer. See the High Elder if you wish.}
{127}{}{Oh come on, please?}
{128}{}{All right, fine. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{129}{Rhom10}{There are rumors of a strange army gathering. I will not say more.}
{130}{}{Oh, come on, pretty please?}
{131}{}{Can I ask you a few more questions though?}
{132}{Rhom11}{ No.}
{133}{}{Oh come on, pretty please?}
{134}{}{Okay. Can I ask you a few more questions though?}
{135}{Rhom12}{Yes. That is all there needs to be.}
{136}{}{Your life sounds really empty.}
{137}{}{Really?}
{138}{Rhom13}{You do not understand what it is to be a Paladin. Too bad.}
{139}{}{You think I could become a Paladin?}
{140}{}{Being a Knight sounds stupid.}
{141}{}{Nope, I guess not. Can you answer some more questions?}
{142}{Rhom14}{Possibly. When the invading army is vanquished, come back to be trained.}
{143}{}{I think I'll do that, thanks.}
{144}{}{By you? I could wipe the floor with you!}
{145}{Rhom15}{Was there anything else?}
{146}{}{Yes. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{147}{}{No, thanks.}
{148}{Rhom16}{Goodbye then.}
{149}{Rhom17}{It takes too long. I spend my time improving those already trained.}
{150}{}{Sounds very boring.}
{151}{}{That's it? That's your life?}
{152}{}{Darn. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{153}{Rhom18}{Ha ha ha! Let's see.}
{154}{Rhom19}{The Scribes copy the plans for the weapons, and the Knights make them. The Paladins protect the Brotherhood from harm.}
{155}{}{What kind of harm can there be?}
{156}{}{God, that sounds boring.}
{157}{Rhom20}{Many covet our technology. We have at least four attacks a week, from raiders to just people who want to steal what we have.}
{158}{}{Oh. Can I ask you a few more questions?}
{159}{Rhom21}{Talk to Vree in the main library.}
{160}{Rhom22}{I do not put stock in rumors.}
{161}{}{Oh come on, just one? Please?}
{162}{}{Fine.}
{163}{Rhom23}{The Hub and the Boneyard are south, mountains are east, and desolate wasteland north. Whoever goes there never returns.}
{164}{Rhom24}{Put that back now!}
{165}{Rhom25}{This is what we do to criminals...}
{166}{Rhom26}{Stop that!}
{167}{Rhom27}{So you are a thief? I will show you what we do with thieves...}
{168}{}{No wait! I can explain!}
{169}{}{Go ahead. Take your best shot.}
{170}{Rhom28}{All right, explain yourself, Initiate.}
{171}{}{I was just looking around!}
{172}{}{I'm sorry. I didn't know this was your room.}
{173}{Rhom29}{Then leave, and I will forget this little incident.}
{174}{}{Okay, thanks.}
{175}{}{Darn right, you will.}
{176}{Rhom30}{You lie, Initiate! This is how we deal with thieves...}
{177}{Rhom32}{You are either stupid or making fun of me. Either way, I will not waste my time.}
{178}{Rhom33}{Talk to Talus, my second in command. He can tell you more about that.}
{179}{Rhom34}{I said...}
{180}{Rhom35}{Like I just told you...}
{181}{Rhom36}{I will not repeat myself again.}
{182}{Rhom37}{Do you not hear? I will not say it again!}
{183}{Rhom38}{She is the Head Scribe. You can find her in the library.}
{184}{Rhom39b}{That is me.}
{185}{}{Talus is my second-in-command.}
{186}{Rhom40}{Ah, General Maxson was the finest Head Paladin ever. When he took over as High Elder, I became Head Paladin.}
{187}{Rhom41}{They copy the weapon documents down and come up with new ideas. What they research, the Knights make.}
{188}{Rhom42}{They are the makers of the weapons.}
{189}{Rhom43}{The Hub is south. We trade with them.}
{190}{Rhom44}{Ask Vree. She would know.}
{191}{Rhom45}{I am not authorized to discuss that. Talk to the High Elder.}
{192}{Rhom46}{The Boneyard is far south. You will find only violence there.}
{193}{Rhom47}{I do not know of that.}
{194}{Rhom48}{I have never heard of that.}
{195}{Rhom49}{I have no knowledge of such a thing.}
{200}{}{I'm new here and I don't know my way around.}
{201}{}{I need not explain anything to you, freak.}
{202}{}{Thank you. Bye.}
{203}{}{Go to hell.}
{204}{}{The door creaks when you try to open it.}
{205}{}{Your skill allows you to steal silently. You make no sound while opening the locker.}
{206}{}{Who is there?}
{207}{}{You were startled and dropped your loot.}
{208}{}{This locker is not locked.}
{209}{}{Stay out of my quarters!}
{210}{}{I'm innocent!}



{980}{Rhom47}{I do not know of that.}
{981}{Rhom48}{I have never heard of that.}
{982}{Rhom49}{I have no knowledge of such a thing.}
