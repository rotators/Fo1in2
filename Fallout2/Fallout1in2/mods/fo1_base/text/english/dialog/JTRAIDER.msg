{100}{}{You see a raider who seems crazed.}
{101}{}{That's it! Don't come any closer. I'll off her. I swear.}
{102}{}{Nung!}
{103}{}{Don't do it!}
{104}{}{If you don't let her go, I'm gonna kill you.}
{105}{}{There is no need for violence. Let's talk about this.}
{106}{}{What? You just want to kill me, don't you? Just remember, this is your fault.}
{107}{}{Any why not? She's just a whore.}
{108}{}{She has as much right to live as you do.}
{109}{}{No. No way. Not this bitch.}
{110}{}{What world do you live in? Out here in the real world, blood flows, man. Blood flows, and it's gonna spill all over this room if you don't get out of here.}
{111}{}{We can talk this over. What can I do to help?}
{112}{}{Okay, okay. I'm backing off. You don't have to worry about me.}
{113}{}{Geez, that's funny. Who says I want help?}
{114}{}{You do. By holding this woman hostage, you're asking for help. I can help.}
{115}{}{I gotta think about this. Give me a moment.}
{116}{}{Yeah. Don't try anything, or she gets it.}
{117}{}{man}
{118}{}{woman}
{119}{}{Oh, big man. Let's see you try. But first...}
{120}{}{Oh, big woman. Let's see you try. But first...}
{121}{}{Stay back... I don't want to hurt her, but I will.}
{122}{}{Don't, or I'll have to hurt you.}
{123}{}{Why do you want to hurt her?}
{124}{}{Try it, and she dies first. Now, what were you saying?}
{125}{}{It'll be hard to hurt her with that hole in your head.}
{126}{}{Okay, but you got to keep talking to me.}
{127}{}{What hole?}
{128}{}{The one I'm gonna put there right now.}
{129}{}{I'll keep talking as long as you do, but try anything tricky, and she'll take the fall.}
{130}{}{I don't have to do anything. You got to do it, and you ain't doing so hot.}
{131}{}{She laughed at me. They all laughed at me. I'll make 'em pay, I swear.}
{132}{}{I trust you. Let's work through this, okay?}
{133}{}{Maybe. I dunno.}
{134}{}{guy}
{135}{}{gal}
{136}{}{You sound like an all right kind of guy. No one ever wanted to help me before. I think we can talk some more.}
{137}{}{You sound like an all right kind of gal. No one ever wanted to help me before. I think we can talk some more.}
{138}{}{Just leave me alone. I hate you! You are the devil. I won't listen to you.}
{139}{}{Have it your way.}
{140}{}{You have to hear me out. Your life, and the life of the girl, depend on it.}
{141}{}{Just relax. I won't harm you. I just want to listen to what you have to say.}
{142}{}{There you go again, threatening me. Die!!}
{143}{}{I won't listen to you. You're just going to trick me with your words. I don't believe you. Go away.}
{144}{}{You might have a point. Prove it to me.}
{145}{}{Where do we go from here?}
{146}{}{You tell me. You're in charge.}
{147}{}{I want some money, and I want to get out of here peacefully. No one follows me.}
{148}{}{Sorry, we can't do that.}
{149}{}{Sure.}
{150}{}{No money, but you can just walk away. No one will do anything. I promise.}
{151}{}{Okay, but you have to let the girl go first. Show me some trust, and I'll trust you.}
{152}{}{You lied to me!}
{153}{}{Okay. I want 100 caps. Then we walk out of here. No one follows me, and I'll let her go when we get to the edge of town.}
{154}{}{Here's your money.}
{155}{}{I don't have that kind of cash on me.}
{156}{}{Then I guess she gets it.}
{157}{}{That's okay, I guess.}
{158}{}{I don't like it. What stops you from just shooting me in the back when I walk out of here?}
{159}{}{I won't shoot you. Trust me.}
{160}{}{Nothing, you'll just have to believe what I say.}
{161}{}{No way! I don't trust you!}
{162}{}{All right. We'll see what happens, won't we.}
{163}{}{Here's 100 caps. Have a good day.}
{164}{}{You can leave peacefully.}
{165}{}{I want my money. I want 200 caps.}
{166}{}{I don't have enough money.}
{167}{}{Here you go.}
{168}{}{You seem like a liar and a cheat to me.}
{169}{}{Feeling's mutual bud. Let the girl go.}
{170}{}{man}
{171}{}{woman}
{172}{}{Why don't you pick on me instead of her? See what a real man can do.}
{173}{}{Why don't you pick on me instead of her? See what a real woman can do.}
{174}{}{No! Don't tell me what to do! You can't tell me what to do!}
{175}{}{Yeah, I'm gonna show you.}
{176}{}{You just cost this whore her life!}
{177}{}{Leave me alone, dammit!}
{178}{}{The raider, intent upon his business, ignores you.}
{179}{}{Hmmm...}
{180}{}{Hey, let's get it on, baby. I got the cash if you've got the time.}
{181}{}{You don't talk to me like that, bitch! Nobody talks to me like that!}
{182}{}{That just cost you your life!}
{183}{}{Your carefully-placed blow knocks the raider unconscious. He collapses like a rag doll.}
{184}{}{You might be able to sneak up on the raider if you're careful.}
