{100}{}{You see: Jasmine.}
{101}{}{Excuse me, sir, this person is a member of one of the merchant guilds.}
{102}{}{Let me get this straight; you're shooting my boss and my friends, and you want to talk? Get bent!}
{103}{}{The door's over there. Don't let it hit you on the way out.}
{104}{}{Hi. Welcome to the Thieves' Circle. Play your cards right and you're in.}
{105}{}{Welcome to the Thieves' Circle. I'm Jasmine. I'm here to help make your infiltration of the 
Daren Hightower estate as painless as possible. Hightower's estate is located in the Heights. It has a 
minimum of two guards on duty at all times. The necklace is probably in a strongbox, which often have 
some minor traps, so be careful. Here are some lockpicks and a couple of flares to make your job a little 
easier... and a bottle of Nuka-Cola. Try not to kill Mr. Hightower. He's one of our 'favorite' people. You 
got all that?}
{106}{}{What do you mean by 'favorite'?}
{107}{}{Lockpicks and flares? That's all?}
{108}{}{Nuka-Cola?}
{109}{}{Don't kill him? No promises, woman.}
{110}{}{This job sucks. Find someone else.}
{111}{}{No problem. I'm outta here.}
{112}{}{Runk!}
{113}{}{Excuse me, sir, but shouldn't you be working on your assignment?}
{114}{}{Excuse me, miss, but shouldn't you be working on your assignment?}
{117}{}{Hi again. If you've got the necklace, you'll have to give it to Mr. Loxley before you get your reward.}
{118}{}{Well done, lad. Here's your reward. [Jasmine gives you 3000 caps]}
{119}{}{Well done, miss. Here's your reward. [Jasmine gives you 3000 caps]}
{121}{}{By the way, here's a little something extra to help you out in your future felonious forays.}
{122}{}{Hello again.}
{123}{}{Well, he's been our benefactor on many occasions. If you kill him, someone smarter may take his place. 
We wouldn't like that.}
{124}{}{Pfah! A real thief lives on her wits. We're being generous with you. Now scat!}
{125}{}{They're our corporate sponsor. Loxley got thirsty, and they 'donated' several dozen bottles to us. Real nice of them to help us out.}
{126}{}{Hmm, don't think I like the attitude. Oh well, nobody's perfect.}
{127}{}{Fine. I think I can speak for Mr. Loxley when I say that I hope we never cross paths again. Get out of here.}
{128}{}{Good luck. Diamonds are my second favorite thing in the world!}
{129}{}{Right. Runk. Sure.}
{130}{}{We warned you, but you didn't listen. Too bad about that hearing problem.}
{131}{}{I think you just failed the test! Don't come back.}
{132}{}{Excuse me, sir, this person is a member of one of the merchant guilds.}
{133}{}{We warned you, but you didn't listen. Too bad about that hearing problem.}
{134}{}{Pfah! A real thief lives on her wits. We're being generous with you miss. Now scat!}
{135}{}{[Jasmine hands you a set of Electronic Lockpicks]}
