{100}{}{You see: Romero.}
{103}{}{You see a member of the Blades.}
{104}{}{You see a member of the Blades.}
{105}{}{You think that might be Books.}
{106}{}{You think that might be Scars.}
{107}{}{You think that might be Gunner.}
{108}{}{You think that might be Twitch.}
{109}{}{You think that might be Hammer.}
{110}{}{You think that might be Razor.}
{111}{}{Stand down!}
{112}{}{What? What do you mean exactly?}
{113}{}{Never!}
{114}{}{I'm here to talk about peace.}
{115}{}{Okay...}
{116}{}{I ask the questions here. What are you doing here?}
{117}{}{I'm here looking for a friend.}
{118}{}{I'm here to talk about peace.}
{119}{}{I want to end the war with Adytum!}
{120}{}{I want to drink the blood of the Blades!}
{121}{}{Then you're looking in the wrong place. Get lost.}
{122}{}{You must be one of those wimpy little purple robes. Get out of here before we blow you away.}
{123}{}{Wait! I don't know what you're talking about. I'm here for Adytum. They want me to get everyone to leave them alone.}
{124}{}{Peace THIS!}
{125}{}{Sorry. I'll be going now.}
{126}{}{Hmm. If you are really from Adytum, then you are still a loser. There can never be peace while those Regulators are still around.}
{127}{}{What do you mean?}
{128}{}{Uh, sure.}
{129}{}{Ask Razor. She'll explain about those bloodthirsty inbreeds.}
{130}{}{Get lost!}
{131}{}{Hey, now that you're a Blade, I need to ask you a favor.}
{132}{}{Sure.}
{133}{}{What is it?}
{134}{}{No way.}
{135}{}{Great. Take this locket to Julianna. Tell her that I hope to see her soon.}
{136}{}{It seems that I have fallen for a girl in Adytum. Because of the Regulators shooting us on sight, I can't get close to her.}
{137}{}{How can I help?}
{138}{}{Go on.}
{139}{}{Tough luck.}
{140}{}{If you take this locket to Julianna, I would be in your debt.}
{141}{}{Sure thing.}
{142}{}{Find someone else.}
{143}{}{With allies like you, who needs enemies? Goodbye!}
{144}{}{I think she loves me too, but I don't know. The Blades won't risk letting me try to break into Adytum.}
{145}{}{Tough luck.}
{146}{}{Okay, I'll help.}
{147}{}{Thank you! She sent me a note. We are going to meet at the Follower's place and get married.}
{148}{}{Welcome back.}
{149}{}{Thank you so much. We will stay here with the Followers now, where we can be happily married.}
