{100}{}{You see Lenny.}
{101}{}{You see a loser who smells like a Brahmin.}
{102}{}{[more]}
{103}{}{[done]}
{104}{}{You hurt one of my friends! We'll make you pay for that! Get 'em, girls!}
{105}{}{Uh, hi.}
{106}{}{What are you doing here?}
{107}{}{What are these animals?}
{108}{}{How come these animals stink so much?}
{109}{}{They do? I hadn't noticed. I guess I've been hanging around them
 for so long, it doesn't bother me. They're my friends.}
{110}{}{These are Brahmin. They're my friends. I sleep in the pen with them so
 they don't get frightened at night. This place can get a little scary, if you
 know what I mean.}
{111}{}{I don't know what you mean. Why is this place scary?}
{112}{}{Can I buy one?}
{113}{}{NO! No! I'm not a slaver, like some of these people. How could you sell
 your friends!?}
{114}{}{I didn't mean it, they're just animals.}
{115}{}{I wouldn't do that, I was just testing you.}
{116}{}{Easy, I make more money that way.}
{117}{}{Oh, I understand. You don't realize how important Brahmin are to me.
 That's okay. I don't think people understand me.}
{118}{}{Uh, bye.}
{119}{}{You're mean. I hate you.}
{120}{}{Whatever.}
{121}{}{Oh. Oh, I get it. Hey, you're kinda nice. I like you. I should warn
 you about those Fool guys. They don't like me. They don't like anyone.}
{122}{}{Thanks for the info.}
{123}{}{The bad people. They fight over things. Things I don't understand.
 The worst are the Fools. They pick on me. They don't like me. [sniff]
 I don't like them.}
{124}{}{Oh, it's you again.}
{125}{}{Tell me what you know about the Fools.}
{126}{}{Tell me what you know about the Crypts.}
{127}{}{I want to know about the power generator.}
{128}{}{See you around.}
{129}{}{I don't like the Fools, they're always picking on me. They live in the
 garage to the north. They fight the Crypts, but we all lose.}
{130}{}{Thanks.}
{131}{}{The Crypts are really mean. They hold the 'lectricity and if we are
 bad, they take it away from us. They hate the Fools, worse than any.
 Worse than they hate my friends.}
{132}{}{What's the 'lectricity?}
{133}{}{The gen'rator? Oh, I don't know about that.}
{134}{}{It feeds the lights. It makes all the stuff go. I don't know, but
 if we don't have it, it's not good.}
{135}{}{I'm not gonna talk to you.}
{136}{}{I'm spending some time with my friends. I spend a lot of time with them.
 They're nice. They don't treat me bad. Not like some people.
 [Lenny squints his eyes.] I hate some people. I hate the Fools.}
{137}{}{You scare me.}
{138}{}{That was nice, but you didn't answer my question.}
{139}{}{Oh, sorry. Lex says I scare him, too. I don't mean it. And I never scare
 my friend.}
{140}{}{What are your friends?}
{141}{}{Who is Lex?}
{142}{}{Oh, I watch the Brahmin and make sure nothing happens to them.}
{143}{}{Now, that wasn't so difficult, was it? What are your friends?}
{144}{}{Lex is nice. Lex treats my friends like family. About once a month,
 he even takes one of my friends home for dinner. [Lenny smiles.] Then he
 lets them play with a bunch of sky Brahmin. Isn't that nice?}
{145}{}{Yes, Lenny, it's very nice. Now tell me about your friends.}
{146}{}{Lenny, I think you need to know something. Lex eats your friends.}
{147}{}{No, you lie! You are a liar! Lex would never do that! You stinking
 liar! I'm going to hurt you for saying that in front of my friends.}
