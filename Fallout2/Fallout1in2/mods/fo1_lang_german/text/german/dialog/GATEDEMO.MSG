{107}{}{A Junktown gate guard.}
{108}{}{What are you doing in Junktown, stranger?}
{109}{}{Looking for a little fun.}
{110}{}{Give me everything you have!}
{111}{}{Might you assist me in acquiring equipment?}
{112}{}{Nothing. Thank you. Good bye.}
{113}{}{There are a lot of things to do here. Let's see. You can practice your aim on the cows,
 or you can just wander around Junktown and see the sights, as long as you don't start any trouble.}
{114}{}{Is there anything else around here?}
{115}{}{Fine! Give me everything you have!}
{116}{}{Thank you. Good bye.}

 nasty gun.  Maybe you can find it.}
{123}{}{Sorry, I'm just a guard.  Try talking with some of the other residents.}
{124}{}{This is just a taste of things which you can do when the full game comes out. You can either:
 kill everything that gets in your way, pilfer and sneak your way through situations, or you can
 talk your way out of trouble and into the graces of others.}
{125}{}{When the full game comes out, you will be able to see more use of your skills than here.}
