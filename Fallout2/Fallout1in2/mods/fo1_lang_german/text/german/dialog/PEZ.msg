{100}{}{You see a peasant.}
{101}{}{Thanks for getting rid of the gangs, but without the generator,
 we are going to have a worse life.}
{102}{}{I'm cold.}
{103}{}{I want some lights.}
{104}{}{We should thank you, I think.}
{105}{}{If you don't kill all the gangs, they are going to take their revenge on us!}
{106}{}{You started this bloodbath, you finish it.}
{107}{}{I would help, but I have this bad knee.}
{108}{}{This is all your fault.}
{109}{}{Violence doesn't stop anything.}
{110}{}{I thought you were a good guy.}
{111}{}{Just another Crypt. I suppose you are going to hurt me now.}
{112}{}{I won't cause trouble.}
{113}{}{Please leave me alone.}
{114}{}{I heard you joined the Fools.}
{115}{}{It's a Fool! Oops, I didn't mean it that way.}
{116}{}{I won't cause any trouble.}
{117}{}{Please leave me alone.}
{118}{}{I promise to laugh at your jokes.}
{119}{}{I'm hungry.}
{120}{}{Where have all the good people gone?}
{121}{}{Is Phil still having trouble with that dog?}
{122}{}{Scrapheap is going to blow away into the desert wind, if those
 gangs have their way.}
{123}{}{It's cold at night without the heaters.}
{124}{}{Those Brahmin sure do stink during the summer.}
{125}{}{Electricity, electricity.}
{126}{}{Hi.}
