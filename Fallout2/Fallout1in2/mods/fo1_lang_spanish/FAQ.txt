Fallout v.1.2.1 patch (semi-official)

Frequently Asked Questions

===============================================================================

Q: I already have Fallout v1.2. Should I install this patch?
A: Yes. You HAVE to install this patch if you want to use any other mods
or patches from TeamX. Mods expect to have latest patch as a platform. And
patches are NOT cumulative. Which means that you have to install all of them
sequentially. You HAVE to install the patch v1.2.1 as well if you want to use
Sfall. It doesn't recognize UK executables. Morover patch has some features
specific for release v1.2 only.

Q: I have installed the patch v1.2.1 but version string in the main menu still
reads as 'Fallout v1.2', is it normal?
A: Yes, it is normal. Version number is hardcoded in the executable file. And we
decided to leave it intact, scince there were no changes made to the engine
itself.

Q: I have installed your patch but game still crashes when I enter third level
of the Cathedral or some places of the Military Base.
A: That's a well known issue specific for the disk images downloaded from the
Internet. You could try 'Cathedral fix' (http://teamx.ru/node/171) but it's
strongly recommended to get a healthy copy of the installation disk. We won't
include the fix into the current patch because broken images are obviously
out of it's scope.

Q: Does your patch contain Celestial's ammo fix?
A: No. Well known 'Ammo patch' by Celestial in fact doesn't fix real bug in
the damage calculation formula at all. It just alters damage values for some
types of the amunition mostly to make .223 less ultimative caliber. Custom
weapon rebelancing has nothing to do with bug fixes.
