;This file handles modifications to perks and traits

;When adding extra perks to a mod, it's advisable to use the fake perk scripting functions rather than make modifications
; in this file, as some perks have hardcoded effects which may catch you out

;Since traits need to be picked before any scripts run, they have an additional NoHardcode option in this file which can
; be used to remove their hardcoded effects, and add new stat/skill effects

;Set to 1 to enable the modifications for perks
Enable=1

;Name: The name of the perk (max 63 characters)
;Desc: The description of the perk (max 255 characters)
;Image: The line number (0-indexed) of the corresponding FRM in skilldex.lst
;Ranks: The number of perk levels
;Level: The minimum required level
;Type: If 0, the perk checks only Skill1 for skill requirements; if 1, it checks Skill1 or Skill2; if 2, it checks both Skill1 and Skill2
;Stat: The modified stat or -1 if you don't want to change any stats
;StatMag: The increased/decreased value to the modified stat

;Skill1/Skill2: The first/second skill (or -1 for none) to check, but if you set a specific bit 0x4000000 (67108864), it checks GVAR.
; For example, if Skill1=0x4000004, then the perk will check GVAR_BAD_MONSTER (0x4000000 + 4) on Skill1Mag value

;Skill1Mag/Skill2Mag: Positive value is used as the minimum requirements of the first/second skill/GVAR, and a negative value is interpreted as the maximum requirement.
; For example, with Skill1=0 and Skill1Mag=100, if player has small guns skill >= 100 and meets all other requirements, the perk will be available in the
; selection window; with Skill1=1 and Skill1Mag=-120, the perk will not be available if player has big guns skill >= 120

;STR-LCK: Positive values are used as minimum requirements of SPECIAL stats, and negative values are interpreted as maximum requirements.
; For some special perks processed by the engine (e.g. PERK_armor_powered and PERK_armor_combat), the values are not used as requirements
; but to add to corresponding SPECIAL stats

;If the value is set to -99999, the variable will be ignored (similar to comment out that line)

;You can add simple extra perks with ID numbers from 119 to 255
; that do not require using scripting functions to change player stats, and can also be used for Armor perks
;These parameters are only for extra perks
;Stat1/Stat2: same as Stat
;Stat1Mag/Stat2Mag: same as StatMag
;Skill3-Skill5: The skill to be modified (or -1 for none)
;Skill3Mod-Skill5Mod: The increased/decreased value to the modified skill
