# Fallout et tu

A Fallout to Fallout 2 engine conversion (also called Fallout 1@2, 1at2, or 1in2) brought to you by Rotators (the people who made FOnline: 2238 and stuff).

The aim of this project is to bring the first Fallout game into the engine of the second while utilizing Fallout 2's features wherever we can (within reason).
Generally we do not try to make a 1:1 copy of the first game. So, if you want to play the 100% real deal, the very pure experience so to speak, you should grab the original Fallout 1 instead of this mod.

However, if you do not mind the one or the other change in mechanics, then Fallout et tu can be your way to go!

## Features
- Replicates Fallout 1 in 2 almost 1:1.
- Comes with the Hero Appearance mod integrated (Bald Dude, Long Hair Dude, Punk Girl).
- Selected Fallout 2 weapons have been added (sparingly!) to the game world in ways that don't break the game balance.
- Fallout 2 styled merchant inventory restocking (Optional).
- Party members and generic NPCs can be pushed out of the way.
- Party members level up and change their appearance based on worn armor.
- Party members can be controlled in combat (Optional).
- Automatic door opening and closing (Optional).
- Traverse the wastes on your very own motorcycle (Optional)!
- Continue playing after the main story has been completed (Optional).
- Lots of bugfixes, making the game run more stable than even the original with patches.

Not to forget:

This project is a more accessible modding platform and allows the creation of complex modifications, which wouldn't be possible with the engine of the first game!
