ScanMsg
=======

Small tool for Fallout modders, trying to find most and least common mistakes in .msg files.

--------

Application checks all .msg files in current directory and subdirectories, and reports all errors found,
as well as weird syntax which might lead to problems.

In case application wasn't started from command line, log file is created.
