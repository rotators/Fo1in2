[ExtraPatches]
;This section allows you to set multiple paths to folders containing mods or patches
;Paths to folders and Fallout .dat files are supported
;The PatchFileXX options are available from 0 to 99. Larger numbers take precedence over smaller numbers (same as patchXXX.dat)
;Starting from 4.4/3.8.40, the game will load custom .dat files and folders from <GameRoot>\mods\mods_order.txt
;The files and folders in mods_order.txt will have a higher priority than the PatchFileXX options
;The complete order of how the engine loads game data is:
;master_patches > critter_patches > mods_order.txt > PatchFileXX > patchXXX.dat > sfall.dat > critter_dat > f2_res_patches > f2_res_dat > master_dat
;PatchFile0=mods\RP_data

;Some details about mods_order.txt:
;If mods_order.txt does not exist, sfall will create one in <GameRoot>\mods\
;To install a new mod, copy the file/folder to <GameRoot>\mods\ and add its name to mods_order.txt
;Mods will be loaded line by line from top to bottom. You can change the load order in a text editor
;To disable a mod temporarily, you can comment it out by adding a ';' or '#' to the beginning of the line
