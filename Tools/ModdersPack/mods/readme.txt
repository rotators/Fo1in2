To install each mod, copy *.int file into your <Fallout Dir>\data\scripts\ folder.
For gl_npcarmor.int, you also need to copy npcarmor.ini to your Fallout directory.

gl_highlighting.int and gl_partycontrol.int are already included in sfall.dat.
You don't usually need to install them separately.
