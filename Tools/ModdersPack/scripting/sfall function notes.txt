-------------------------------------
---------- GLOBAL SCRIPTS -----------
-------------------------------------

As well as the new functions, sfall also adds global scripts. These run independent of any loaded maps, but do not have an attached object. (i.e. using self_obj without using set_self first will crash the script.) To use a global script, the script must have a name which begins with 'gl' and contains a procedure called 'start', 'map_enter_p_proc', 'map_exit_p_proc', or 'map_update_p_proc'. The start procedure will be executed once when the player loads a saved game or starts a new game. The map_*_p_proc procedures will be executed once when a map is being entered/left/updated. If you wish the script to be executed repeatedly, call set_global_script_repeat on the first run of the start procedure using the number of frames between each run as the argument. (0 disables the script, 1 runs it every frame, 2 runs it every other frame etc.)

Global scripts have multiple modes, which can be set using the set_global_script_type function. In the default mode (i.e. mode 0) their execution is linked to the local map game loop, so the script will not run in dialogs or on the world map. In mode 1 their execution is linked to the player input, and so they will run whenever the mouse cursor is visible on screen, including the world map, character dialogs etc. In mode 2, execution is linked to the world map loop, so the script will only be executed on the world map and not on the local map or in any dialog windows. Mode 3 is a combination of modes 0 and 2, so scripts will be executed on both local maps and the world map, but not in dialog windows. Using mode 1 requires the input wrapper to be enabled. Use available_global_script_types to check what is available.



-------------------------------------
------ NOTES ON NEW FUNCTIONS -------
-------------------------------------

Both set_global_script_repeat and set_global_script_type only have an effect on the script they were called from. Every global script needs its own game_loaded block to correctly set up the script type and repeat rate. set_global_script_repeat will have no effect if called on a non-global script.

The read_xxx functions take a memory address as the parameter and can read arbitrary pieces of Fallout's address space. The write functions are equivalent except that they write to arbitrary memory addresses. The call_offset_xx functions can be used to call arbitrary functions inside Fallout. Different versions are used to call functions with different numbers of arguments. None of these functions will work unless AllowUnsafeScripting is enabled in ddraw.ini

The get/set_pc_base/extra_stat functions are equivalent to calling get/set_critter_base/extra_stat with dude_obj as the critter pointer. None of these stat functions take perks into account, and neither do they do range clamping to make sure the stats are valid. Use the normal get_critter_stat function to get a correctly perk adjusted and range clamped value for a stat.

The set_stat_max/min functions can be used to set the valid ranges on on stats. Values returned by get_current_stat will be clamped to this range. The set_pc_ function only effect the player, the set_npc_ functions only effect other critters, and the set_ functions effect both.

The input functions are only available if the user has the input hook turned on in ddraw.ini. Use input_funcs_available to check.

The graphics functions are only available if the user is using graphics mode 4 or 5. Use graphics_funcs_available to check; it returns 1 if you can use them or 0 if you can't. Calling graphics functions when graphics_funcs_available returns 0 will do nothing.

load_shader takes a path relative to the <GameRoot>\<master_patches>\shaders\ directory as an argument and returns a shader ID. That ID should be passed as the first argument to all other shader functions, and is valid until free_shader is called on the ID, the player loads a saved game or the player quits to the main menu.

get_shader_version gives you the highest shader version supported by the player's graphics cards. Possible return values are 11, 12, 13, 14, 20, 21 and 30.

set_shader_mode tells sfall when to use a shader. The parameter is a set of 32 flags which specify the screens on which the shader will be disabled, unless bit 32 is set, in which case the shader will only be active on those screens. Remember that screens are displayed on top of each other; if the player opens the character menu which in combat, the game still considers the player to be in combat. See sfall.h for a list of defines.

force_graphics_refresh forces the screen to redraw at times when it normally wouldn't. If you're using animated shader, turning this option on is recommended.

The mapper manual lists the functions 'world_map_x_pos' and 'world_map_y_pos', which supposedly return the player's x and y positions on the world map. get_world_map_x/y_pos are included here anyway, because I was unable to get those original functions to work, or even to find any evidence that they existed in game.

set_pipboy_available will only accept 0 or 1 as an argument. Using any other value will cause the function to have no effect. Use 0 to disable the pipboy, and 1 to enable it.

get/set_critter_current_ap functions should only be used during the target critters turn while in combat. Calling them outside of combat typically returns the critters max ap, but don't rely on that behaviour. (Specifically, if the critter has never before entered combat, it will probably return the critters base ap ignoring any extra bonuses from perks etc.) Using set_critter_current_ap on the player will not automatically redraw the screen, so the ap bar will be incorrect until the player next clicks.

The 'type' value in the weapon knockback functions can be 0 or 1. If 0, the value becomes an absolute distance that targets will be knocked back. If 1, the value is multiplied by the distance they would normally have been knocked back. Weapon knockback modifiers are applied in the order weapon -> attacker -> target, so a x2 weapon wielded by an abs 6 attacker hitting a /2 target will knock the target back 3 squares. The knockback functions will not override the stonewall perk or knockdowns resulting from criticals. knockback values set on weapons or critters are not saved, and must be reset each time the player reloads.

The get/set_sfall_global functions require an 8 characters long case sensitive string for the variable name. The variables behave the same as normal Fallout globals, except that they don't have to be declared beforehand in vault13.gam. Trying to get a variable which hasn't been set will always return 0. These functions are intended for use when a patch to a mod requires the addition of a new global variable, a case which would otherwise require the player to start a new game.

set_pickpocket_max and set_hit_chance_max effect all critters rather than just the player. set_skill_max can't be used to increase the skill cap above 300. set_perk_level_mod sets a modifier between +25 and -25 that is added/subtracted from the player's level for the purposes of deciding which perks can be chosen.

set_fake_trait and set_fake_perk can be used to add additional traits and perks to the character screen. They will be saved correctly when the player saves and reloads games, but by themselves they will have no further effect on the character. For perks, the allowed range for levels is between 0 and 100; setting the level to 0 removes that perk. For traits, the level must be 0 or 1. The image is a numeric id that corresponds to an entry in skilldex.lst. The name is limited to 63 characters and the description to 255 characters by sfall, but internal Fallout limits may be lower.

has_fake_trait and has_fake_perk return the number of levels the player has of the perks/traits with the given name or ID of extra perk.

perk_add_mode, set_selectable_perk, set_perkbox_title, hide_real_perks, show_real_perks and clear_selectable_perks control the behaviour of the select a perk box. set_selectable_perk can be used to add additional items by setting the 'active' parameter to 1, and to remove them again by setting it to 0. set_perkbox_title can be used to change the title of the box, or by using "" it will be set back to the default. hide and show_real_perks can be used to prevent the dialog from displaying any of the original 119 perks. perk_add_mode modifies what happens when a fake perk is selected from the perks dialog. It is treated as a set of flags - if bit 1 is set then it is added to the player's traits, if bit 2 is set it is added to the player's perks, and if bit 3 is set it is removed from the list of selectable perks. The default is 0x2. clear_selectable_perks restores the dialog to its default state.

show_iface_tag, hide_iface_tag and is_iface_tag_active relate to the boxes that appear above the interface such as SNEAK and LEVEL. You can use 3 for LEVEL and 4 for ADDICT, or the range from 5 to (4 + the value of BoxBarCount in ddraw.ini) for custom boxes. Remember to add your messages to intrface.msg and set up the font colours in ddraw.ini if you're going to use custom boxes. Starting from sfall 4.1, is_iface_tag_active can also be used to check 0 for SNEAK, 1 for POISONED, and 2 for RADIATED.

get/set_bodypart_hit_modifier alter the hit percentage modifiers for aiming at specific bodyparts. Valid bodypart id's are from 0 to 8. Changes are not saved, and will reset to the defaults (or to the values specified in ddraw.ini if they exist) at each reload.

(re)set/get_critical_table are used for modifying the critical table. For details see 'http://falloutmods.wikia.com/wiki/Critical_hit_tables'. Changes are not saved, and will reset to the defaults, (or to the contents of CriticalOverrides.ini, if it exists,) at each game reload. These function also require OverrideCriticalTable to be set to 1 in ddraw.ini. (Disabled by default, because it noticably increases loading times.)

get/set_unspent_ap_bonus alter the AC bonus you receive per unused action point at the end of your turn in combat. To allow for fractional values, the value given if divided by 4. (Hence the default value is 4 and not 1.) get/set_unspent_ap_perk_bonus are similar, but effect the extra AC granted by the h2h evade perk. (The default value of this is also 4, equivalent to doubling the original bonus.)

nb_* functions are reserved for the brotherhood tactical training mod, and should be avoided.

The fs_* functions are used to manipulate a virtual file system. Files saved here should have paths relative to the data folder, and use backslashes as the directory separator. They will take precedence over files stored in the normal data folder. They will also be saved into save games if you set a flag for them using fs_resize(fileId, -1), so be avoid creating large files. Using fs_copy followed by fs_read_xxx, you can read the contents of existing files.

get/set_proto_data are used to manipulate the in memory copies of the .pro files Fallout makes when they are loaded. The offset refers to the offset in memory from the start of the proto to the element you are reading. Changes are not stored on disc, and are not permanent. If you modify the protos, and then Fallout subsequently reloads the file your changes will be lost.

the list_xxx functions can be used to loop over all items on a map. list_begin takes an argument telling sfall what you want to list. (Defined in sfall.h) It returns a list pointer, which you iterate through with list_next. Finally, when you've finished with the list use list_end on it. Not calling list_end will result in a memory leak. Alternatively, use list_as_array to get the whole list at once as a temp array variable, which can be looped over using len_array and which you don't need to remember to free afterwards.

play_sfall_sound and stop_sfall_sound are used to play mp3/wav/wma files. The path given is relative to the Fallout folder. Specify loop as 1 to loop the file continuously, or 0 otherwise. If you don't wish to loop, play_sfall_sound returns 0. If you do loop, it returns an id which can be passed back to stop_sfall_sound when you want to stop the effect. All sounds effects will be stopped on game reload, looping or not. These functions do not require 'AllowDShowSound' to be set to 1 in ddraw.ini.

arrays are created and manipulated with the xxx_array functions. An array must first be created with create_array or temp_array, specifying how many data elements the array can hold. You can store any of ints, floats and strings in an array, and can mix all 3 in a single array. The id returned by create/temp_array can then be used with the other array functions. Arrays are shared between all scripts. (i.e. you can call create_array from one script, and then use the returned id from another script.) They are also saved across savegames. You must remember to free any arrays you create with create_array when you are done with them, or you will leak memory. arrays created with temp_array will be automatically freed at the end of the frame. These functions are safe, in that supplying a bad id or trying to access out of range elements will not crash the script. create_array is the only function that returns a permanent array, all other functions which return arrays (string_split, list_as_array etc,) all return temp arrays. You can use fix_array to make a temp array permanent.

NOTE: the above description only applies when "arraysBehavior" is set to 0 in ddraw.ini. Refer to "arrays.txt" for detailed description of new arrays behavior.

force_aimed_shots and disable_aimed_shots allow overriding the normal rules regarding which weapons are allowed to make aimed attacks. (e.g. weapons that cause explosive damage normally cannot normally make aimed shots.) force_aimed_shots will allow a weapon to make aimed shots even if it normally couldn't, and disable_aimed_shots stops a weapon from making aimed shots even if it normally could. Both of these functions affect player and NPCs alike. force_aimed_shots does not override the effects of the fast shot trait. The list of edited weapons is not saved over game loads, so you need to call the functions once at each reload. Use a pid of 0 to represent unarmed.

get/set_critter_skill_points will get/set the number of additional points a critter has in a skill, on top of whatever they have from their stats and other bonuses. Note that skill points are part of the proto, so calling set_skill_points on a critter will affect all critters that share the same proto.



------------------------------
------ TYPES REFERENCE -------
------------------------------

> Data types mentioned in this document:

void - means opcode does not return any value
any - any type
int - integer number
float - floating point number
string - string (text) value
object - pointer to game object (actually an integer)
array - array ID to be used with array-related functions (actually an integer)


----------------------------------------------
------ FUNCTION REFERENCE (incomplete) -------
----------------------------------------------

> int game_loaded()
- returns 1 the first time it is called after a new game or game load, and 0 any time after. It works on an individual basis for each script, so one script wont interfere with others. Its primary use is for global scripts, so that they know when to call set_global_script_repeat, but it can be called from normal scripts too.

> void inc_npc_level(int pid/string name)
- takes a party member PID or an NPC name (deprecated, for compatibility with sfall 4.1.5/3.8.15 or earlier) as an argument. The NPC must be in your party.
- This function ignores player level requirements and the minimum 3 player level delay between NPC level gains. It also ignores the random element, regardless of sfall's NPCAutoLevel setting.

> int get_npc_level(int pid/string name)
- also takes the party member PID or NPC name (deprecated, for compatibility with sfall 4.1.5/3.8.15 or earlier) as an argument, and returns the NPC's current level. Again, the NPC needs to be in your party.

> void set_car_current_town(int town)
- changes the current town index for the player's car

> int get_ini_setting(string setting)
- reads an integer value from an ini file in the Fallout directory.
- It only takes a single argument; seperate the file name, section and key with a '|' character; e.g. 'myvar:=get_ini_setting("myini.ini|mysec|var1")' If the file or key cannot be found, -1 is returned.
- The file name is limited to 63 chars, including the extension.
- The section name is limited to 32 characters.
- It can also be used to get sfalls settings, by using ddraw.ini as the file name.

> string get_ini_string(string setting)
- reads a string value from an ini file in the Fallout directory.

> int get_game_mode()
- is a more flexible version of in_world_map. It will return a set of flags indicating which mode the game is currently in.
- These flags are the same as those used in the set_shader_mode function.

> int get_uptime()
- is just a wrapper around the windows GetTickCount() function. It's useful for making time fade effects in shaders, since they already have access to the current tick count.

> boolean in_world_map()
- returns 1 if the player is looking at the world map, or 0 at any other time.
- Obviously this is only useful in global scripts, since normal scripts will never get the chance to run on the world map.

> void force_encounter(int map)
- can be called either from a global script while traveling on the world map, or from a normal script while on a local map.
- In either case the encounter occurs shortly after the next time the player moves on the world map.
- The player will not get an outdoorsman skill check.

> void force_encounter_with_flags(int map, int flags)
- does the same thing as force_encounter, but allows the specification of some extra options.
- Forcing a random encounter on a map that is not normally used for random encounters may cause the player to lose the car, if they have it.
- In this case use force_encounter_with_flags with the ENCOUNTER_FLAG_NO_CAR flag set.

> int get_light_level()
- ambient light level in range 0..65536
- The value returned by get_light_level may not exactly match that set by set_light_level, as set_light_level applies modifiers from the night vision perk.

> void set_map_time_multi(float multi)
- adjusts how fast time passes while you're on the world map. It takes a single float as an argument, where 1 is the normal speed.
- This function works in addition to the WorldMapTimeMod setting in ddraw.ini and the pathfinder perk, rather than overriding it, so calling set_map_time_multi(0.5) when the player has 2 levels of pathfinder would result in time passing at 25% the normal speed on the world map.

> void remove_script(object)
- accepts a pointer to an object and will remove the script from that object.

> void set_script(object, int scriptid)
- accepts a pointer to an object and scriptID, and applies the given script to an object (scriptID accepts the same values as create_object_sid)
- If used on an object that is already scripted, it will remove the existing script first; you cannot have multiple scripts attached to a single object. Calling set_script on self_obj will have all sorts of wacky side effects, and should be avoided.
- if you add 0x80000000 to the sid when calling set_script, map_enter_p_proc will be SKIPPED. The start proc will always be run.

> int get_script(object)
- accepts a pointer to an object and returns its scriptID (line number in scripts.lst), or 0 if the object is unscripted.
- returns -1 on argument error.

> void set_self(int obj)
- overrides the scripts self_obj for the next function call.
- It is primarily used to allow the calling of functions which take an implicit self_obj parameter (e.g. drop_obj) from global scripts, but it can also be used from normal scripts;
- self_obj will revert back to its original value after the next function call.
- calling self_obj(0) will also revert self_obj to original value. It is recommended to call this after each use of set_self in normal scripts in order to avoid unforeseen side effects.
- source_obj, target_obj, and similar functions will not work if preceded by "set_self"
- NOTE: for use_obj/use_obj_on_obj vanilla functions to work correctly, it is required to call set_self twice.

> void mod_skill_points_per_level(int x)
- accepts a value of between -100 and 100, and modifies the number of skill points the player receives when they level up.
- This is a modification of what would otherwise happen, rather than a replacement.
- The value is not saved into the save game, so should be reset in the game_loaded section of a script.

> void set_perk_freq(int x)
- sets the number of levels between each perk.
- Setting 0 will reset it back to the default.
- This overrides the effects of the skilled trait.
- It is not saved into the save game, so needs to be called once per reload.
- Be careful not to let the player obtain a perk when no perks are available to pick, or the game may crash.

> object get_last_target(object)
- will return the last critter to be deliberately attacked
> object get_last_attacker(object)
- will return the last critter to deliberately launch an attack against the argument critter.
- If a critter has not launched/received an attack, it will return 0. This is only stored for the duration of combat, and outside of combat both functions will always return 0.

> void set_base_pickpocket_mod(int max, int mod)
- changes maximum chance of success and chance mod for each steal attempt
- "max" will replace 95% success chance cap (so you can set 100% maximum chance, for instance)
- "mod" will add this much percent to each success chance. for example if your chance is 50% and "mod" is 20, you will get 70% actual success rate

> void set_critter_pickpocket_mod(object, int max, int mod)
- the same as above, but applies only to specific critter

> void reg_anim_combat_check
- allows to enable all reg_anim_* functions in combat (including vanilla functions) if set to 0. It is automatically reset at the end of each frame, so you need to call it before "reg_anim_begin" - "reg_anim_end" block.


Some additional reg_anim_* functions were introduced. They all work in the same convention as vanilla functions and use the same underlying code.

> void reg_anim_destroy(object)
- given object is destroyed at the end of current animation set

> void reg_anim_animate_and_hide(object, animID, delay)
- exactly like "reg_anim_animate" but the object will automatically disappear after the last animation frame (but not destroyed)

> void reg_anim_light(object, light, delay)
- change light of any object. light argument is a light radius (0-8), but you can use highest 2 bytes to pass light intensity as well (example: 0xFFFF0008 - intensity 65535 and radius 8). If highest 2 bytes are 0, intensity will not be changed. Intensity range is from 0 to 65535 (0xFFFF).

> void reg_anim_change_fid(object, fid, delay)
- should work like art_change_fid_num but in reg_anim sequence

> void reg_anim_take_out(object, holdFrameID, delay)
- plays "take out weapon" animation for given holdFrameID. It is not required to have such weapon in critter's inventory.

> void reg_anim_turn_towards(object, tile/target, delay)
- makes object change its direction to face given tile num or target object.

> void reg_anim_callback(procedure proc)
- adds the given procedure to an animation sequence-list and executes it in the registered sequence.

> int/array metarule2_explosions(int arg1, int arg2, int arg3)
was made as a dirty easy hack to allow dynamically change some explosion parameters (ranged attack). All changed parameters are reset to vanilla state automatically after each attack action. Following macros are available in sfall.h:

> void set_attack_explosion_pattern(x, y)
- currently y is not used and x means: 1 - reduced explosion pattern (3 effects are spawned instead of 7), 0 - full pattern

> void set_attack_explosion_art(x, y)
- y is not used and x is a misc frame ID (last 3 bytes, without object type) to use for the next explosion.

> void set_attack_explosion_radius(x)
- changes radius at which explosion will hit secondary targets for the next attack (from the experiments it is limited to something around 8 by the engine)

> void set_attack_is_explosion_fire
- if you call this right before using a weapon with fire damage type (e.g. in HOOK_AFTERHITROLL), it will produce explosion effects (and radius damage) just like "explosion" type, but all targets will still receive fire damage.

> void set_explosion_radius(grenade, rocket)
- sets a permanent radius of the explosion for grenades and/or rockets. Passing 0 means not changing the corresponding radius.
- changed radius will be reset each time the player reloads the game.

> array get_explosion_damage(itemPid)
- returns array of the minimum and maximum damage of the explosive item.

> void set_dynamite_damage(minDmg, maxDmg)
- sets the minimum and maximum damage for Dynamite.
- changed damage will be reset each time the player reloads the game.

> void set_plastic_damage(minDmg, maxDmg)
- sets the minimum and maximum damage for Plastic Explosives.
- changed damage will be reset each time the player reloads the game.

> void set_explosion_max_targets(x)
- sets the maximum number of additional targets for an explosion, valid range: 1..6 (default is 6)


Some utility/math functions are available:

> array string_split(string, split)
- takes a string and a separator, searches the string for all instances of the separator, and returns a temp array filled with the pieces of the string split at each instance. If you give an empty string as the separator, the string is split into individual characters.
- you can use this to search for a substring in a string like this: strlen(get_array(string_split(haystack, needle), 0))

> string substr(string, start, length)
- cuts a substring from a string starting at "start" up to "length" characters. The first character position is 0 (zero).
- If start is negative - it indicates starting position from the end of the string (for example substr("test", -2, 2) will return last 2 charactes: "st").
- If length is negative - it means so many characters will be omitted from the end of string (example: substr("test", 0, -2) will return string without last 2 characters: "te").
- If length is zero - it will return a string from the starting position to the end of the string **New behavior** for sfall 4.2.2/3.8.22

> int strlen(string string)
- returns string length

> string sprintf(string format, any value)
- formats given value using standard syntax of C printf function (google "printf" for format details). However it is limited to formatting only 1 value.
- can be used to get character by ASCII code ("%c")

> int typeof(any value)
- returns type of the given value: VALTYPE_INT, VALTYPE_FLOAT or VALTYPE_STR.

> int charcode(string string)
- returns ASCII code for the first character in given string

> ^ operator (exponentiation)
- use as any other arithmetic operator, like 5^(1/3)
- if exponent is integer, you can use negative base, otherwise you will get "nan" with negative base
- if both arguments are integers, result will be integer

> float log(float x)
- natural logarithm of x

> float exponent(float x)
- e^x

> int ceil(float x)
- round x to the nearest integer that is not less than x

> int round(float x)
- round x to the nearest integer

> float sqrt(float x)
- square root of x

> int/float abs(int/float x)
- absolute (positive) value of x

> float sin(float x)

> float cos(float x)

> float tan(float x)
- tangent of x

> float arctan(float x, float y)
- arctangent of x
- just pass 1 as y (don't ask...)


> void register_hook_proc(int hook, procedure proc)
- works just like "register_hook", but allows to specify which procedure to use for given hook script (instead of "start")
- use zero (0) as second argument to unregister hook script from current global script
- only use in global scripts
- second argument should be passed just like you pass procedures to functions like gsay_option, giq_option, etc (name without quotes)
- see "hookscripts.txt" for more details

> void register_hook_proc_spec(int hook, procedure proc)
- works just like "register_hook_proc", but allows to register a script at the end of the hook script execution chain (i.e. the script will be executed after all previously registered scripts for the same hook, including the hs_*.int script)
- to unregister hook script from current global script, use the register_hook_proc function

> string message_str_game(int fileId, int messageId)
- works exactly the same as message_str, except you get messages from files in "text\<language>\game\" directory
- use GAME_MSG_* defines or mstr_* macros from sfall.h to use specific msg file
- Additional game msg files added by ExtraGameMsgFileList setting will have consecutive fileIds assigned beginning from 0x2000 to 0x2FFF. (e.g. if you set ExtraGameMsgFileList=foo,bar in ddraw.ini, foo.msg will be associated with 0x2000 and bar.msg with 0x2001.)
- if a file has a specific number assigned in ExtraGameMsgFileList, its fileId will be (0x2000 + assigned number). (e.g. with ExtraGameMsgFileList=foo,bar:2,foobar in ddraw.ini, bar.msg will be associated with 0x2002 and foobar.msg with 0x2003.)

> int sneak_success
- returns 1 if the player is currently sneaking, and last sneak attempt (roll against skill) was successful; 0 otherwise
- this calls an internal engine function which is used to determine the perception range of critters (which you can override using HOOK_WITHINPERCEPTION)

> int tile_light(int elevation, int tileNum)
- returns light intensity at the given tile in range from 0 to 65536

> object obj_blocking_line(object objFrom, int tileTo, int blockingType)
- returns first object which blocks direct linear path from objFrom to tileTo using selected blocking function (see BLOCKING_TYPE_* constants in sfall.h)
- if path is clear (no blocker was encountered by selected function) - returns 0
- objFrom is always excluded from calculations, but is required to be a valid object

> object obj_blocking_tile(int tileNum, int elevation, int blockingType)
- returns first object blocking given tile using given blocking function or 0 if tile is clear

> array tile_get_objs(int tileNum, int elevation)
- returns array of all objects at given tile
- it will include any hidden, dead or system objects (like cursor), so make sure to check properly when iterating

> array party_member_list(int includeHidden)
- returns array of all current party members (0 - only critter-type, alive and visible will be returned, 1 - all object, including Trunk, etc.)

> array path_find_to(object objFrom, int tileTo, int blockingType)
- returns the shortest path to a given tile using given blocking function as an array of tile directions (0..5) to move on each step
- array length equals to a number of steps
- empty array means that specified target cannot be reached

> object create_spatial(int scriptID, int tile, int elevation, int radius)
- creates new spatial script with given SID, at given tile, and radius

> int art_exists(int artFID)
