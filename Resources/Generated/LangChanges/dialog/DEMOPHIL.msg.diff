+{102}{}{It ain't my dog!}
+{103}{}{Damn right, shoot that beast!}
+{104}{}{I wouldn't trust that beast, if I was you.
+ That thing is a killer.}
+{105}{}{Mister,}
+{106}{}{Ma'am,}
+{107}{}{ I would be really happy if you were to get rid of
+ that damn dog.}
+{108}{}{Why?}
+{109}{}{Nah, I only deal with important stuff.}
+{110}{}{Where did it come from?}
+{111}{}{Hnnn.}
+{112}{}{Mebbe you can talk it to death.}
+{113}{}{It won't let us back into our house, that's why.}
+{114}{}{Okay.}
+{115}{}{Isn't it your dog?}
+{116}{}{It was the 'pet' of a traveller. When the traveller died, this
+ damn dog just plopped its furry ass down on my doorstep
+ and wouldn't leave. It's been there for days.}
+{117}{}{Oh.}
+{118}{}{Who was this traveller?}
+{119}{}{What did the traveller look like?}
+{120}{}{I don't know. Some guy. He came from the east, he said.
+ Like anyone could get past the deadlands to the east.
+ He ran afoul of Gizmo, trying to interfere with Gizmo's
+ business.}
+{121}{}{So, Gizmo had a couple of boys beat him up and throw him from
+ the casino roof. The traveller broke his damnfool neck and
+ died. The dog was pissed.}
+{122}{}{What did the traveller look like?}
+{123}{}{Oh, the guy was tall, dark-haired with a little graying
+ around the edges. He was dressed all in black leather,
+ like that's a good idea in the desert, and carried
+ a shotgun.}
+{124}{}{He had some funny accent. The dog was his constant companion,
+ followed him everywhere.}
+{125}{}{Appreciate the gossip.}
+{126}{}{I hate that dog.}
+{127}{}{Thanks for your help.}
+{128}{}{You get 50 experience points.}
