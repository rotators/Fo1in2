+# Chris Avellone is a male bounty hunter. He has an abrupt attitude and is serious about
+# his money. He does not like child killers (which is the only way the player will meet him).

+{101}{}{What do you want?}

+{107}{}{That joke wasn't even funny the first time. You're about to discover why I'm one of the most fearsome bounty hunters in the wasteland. And I won't even get paid for it.}

+{111}{}{[Christopher looks at you, considering something... apparently he already made a decision] Tell me, how often do you visit Hub or Junktown?}
+{112}{}{Often enough, why do you ask?}
+{113}{}{Well, you see... Business takes almost all of my time and I don't have an opportunity to get there. And as an incurable smoker I miss an old Zippo lighter very much. It's said, many of those pre-War items could be found in the shops there. If you get a Zippo for me, I'll share with you some information about the neighboring settlements. I think it could be of use!}
+{114}{}{A pity. Looks like I misjudged you. Get out of here.}
+{115}{}{Why not, I'll get one for you.}
+{116}{}{Okay.}
+{117}{}{Hey, I have one right here. I don't really need it and can give you in exchange for the information.}
+{118}{}{Thank you! [takes the lighter] So, what do you want to hear, exactly?}
+{119}{}{Here is your lighter. Time to give me some information.}
+{120}{}{No more questions, thanks.}

+{122}{}{What else do you want to know?}
+{123}{}{I need some information.}
