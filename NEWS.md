Notable changes since last release ([v1.5.2288](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2/releases/tag/v1.5.2288))

- **Added**: A new option to enable Fo2-style weapon upgrades. Zack at the Gunrunners will upgrade weapons, and Miles in Adytum can produce Flamer Fuel MK2.
- **Added**: All Fo2 lockpick items are now supported in scripts (Lockpicks, Expanded Lockpick set, Electronic Lockpick, Electronic Lockpick MK2).
- **Added**: The Junktown guard in Killian's shop will now move closer to the good tables at night.
- **Added**: With the alternative items reward option for Mathia, it is now possible to get another power armor (player needs to have at least one power armor and one companion).
- **Fixed**: 49/50hp mutants on Mariposa level 1.
- **Fixed**: A potential procedure loop in the (generic) super mutant sergeant script when talking to them in disguise.
- **Fixed**: Cathedral technicians would blast the disguise-check code on every game tick, no matter if they see thep player or not. This can cause the game to crash on certain hardware.
- **Fixed**: Gizmo's dead remains (with flies animation) can now be looted correctly.
- **Fixed**: MacRae in the Boneyard now correctly gives the player +5% Damage Resistance, and + 1% Melee Damage (vanilla Fo1 bug + removed the old Fixt workaround which gave skill points instead).
- **Fixed**: Maxon at the Brotherhood was showing the wrong dialog text after asking about the missing caravans.
- **Fixed**: Mines / Traps spatial scripts had no range assigned to them.
- **Fixed**: Mines in the thief circle map didn't want to explode.
- **Fixed**: Player can enter V13 already after waiting 1 day and not 2.
- **Fixed**: Player can't get the Champion reputation state anymore if he is a childkiller.
- **Fixed**: The Mariposa entrance mutant was showing 60/50 hp for some reason.
- **Fixed**: When using the stealing skill on Dogmeat, an error message would show (old Fixt code).
- **Tweaked**: Hotspots in the Glow will give the player randomly 20 to 50 rads again (reverted Fixt change back to Fo1 vanilla values).
- **Tweaked**: Moved the inventory weapons of Hub entrance guards into their off-hand slots, otherwise they would never use them.
- **Tweaked**: Reverted the MFC -> SEC item change in super mutant encounters, because they seem to drop SECs on purpose and not by bug. 
- **Tweaked**: Rewrote the interaction between Killian and his shopdoor. Also, the inside shopguard will react to the player now if he is found inside the building at night time.
